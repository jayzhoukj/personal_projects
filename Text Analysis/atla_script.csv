1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"As the title card fades, the scene opens onto a shot of an icy sea before panning slowly to the left, revealing more towering icebergs drifting in the water as the shot rotates, moving over a large snow-covered area where the untouched blanket of snow is broken by two tracks of footsteps. The shot fades to another shot of the sea and of icebergs in blue water contrasted by the paleness of the sky beyond. As the shot once again pans to the left and rotates likewise, a small canoe comes into view, its motion through the water indicated by the wake left behind it. The shot zooms slightly on the canoe before cutting down to it, providing a side angle of the canoe and of the walls of ice rising on either side of the vessel. Sokka, a teenage boy, and his younger sister, Katara, a teenage girl, are sitting in the boat; Sokka holds a spear at the ready, while Katara simply stares into the water on the other side of the boat. The shot cuts to an overhead view, revealing that a fish is swimming close to the surface right in front of Sokka, who is focused on it, following its every movement. Cut to a frontal view of him."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"It's not getting away from me this time. [Close-up of Sokka as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of Katara.] Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"The shot pans quickly from Sokka to Katara, who seems indifferent to his claim and turns back to her side of the boat again. Her expression changes to surprise; as the shot jumps behind her, looking down into the water over her shoulder, another fish quickly swims by her, close to where she sits. She shoots a quick glance toward her brother, removing the glove from her left hand. She stretches her arm out in the direction of the fish, taking a deep breath. Her look is a mixture of concentration and apprehension as she starts making a wavy motion with her wrist, moving her hand up and down."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"[Happily surprised.] Sokka, look!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"[Close-up of Sokka; whispering.] Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. [A look of bliss adorns his face. He licks his lips and wiggles his fingers, not taking his eyes off the fish.] Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Behind Sokka, Katara is still making circular movements with both her arms, suspending the bubble of water that holds the fish in the air and moving back and forth. The camera cuts to her face, contorted slightly by the focus it takes to control the water."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"[Struggling with the water that passes right in front of her.] But, Sokka! I caught one!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"The bubble containing her fish slowly drifts around her to hang over Sokka, who is still oblivious. As the bubble hovers over his head, Sokka raises his spear to strike the fish he was following. He bursts the bubble of water with the blunt end of his weapon, causing Katara to lose control of the water; it rains down on Sokka, soaking him."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,[Exclaims indignantly.] Hey!
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"As Sokka lets out a gasp of discomfort, the fish tumbles through the air and Katara follows its arc with her eyes as it flies over her head and splashes back into the sea. Sokka rounds on his sister, placing his spear perpendicular to the rim of the boat as he yells irately. The shot cuts to a close-up of him."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,Sokka clenches his fists and a few drops of water fall from his soaked gloves.
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"[Cut to her face; she sighs lightly before answering in slight annoyance.] It's not ""magic"", it's waterbending! And it's ..."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"[Cutting her off.] Yeah, yeah, ""an ancient art unique to our culture"", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying [Grabbing his warrior's wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her, wringing the water out of it. Meanwhile, Katara has crossed her arms.] that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"[Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still crossed.] You're calling me weird?Â I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Near the end of her response, Katara smiles smugly at her brother; as the shot cuts to him, he is flexing at his reflection in the water and grinning confidently. His happy look vanishes upon hearing his sister's remark and he turns around slowly, meaning to face her. Before he can say anything, however, the canoe suddenly shudders. As they both try to keep from falling over, Sokka whirls around toward his end of the canoe, a frantic look on his face."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,Watch out! Go left! Go left!
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"The shot shows an overview of the ice floes moving closer together in front of the boat, narrowing their path. The boat manages to stay clear of some of the icebergs, but it veers to the right with the current and becomes pinned by three large chunks of ice. As the canoe is completely crushed by the ice, Katara and Sokka throw themselves from the canoe and onto one of the floes; Katara nearly slides off the other side into the water, but comes to a halt at the floe's very edge. As she raises her head, looking around, the shot zooms out to reveal the siblings are floating on one floe among dozens."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,[A touch of bitterness in her voice.] You call that left?
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've [He waves his hands, mockingly imitating waterbending.] waterbended us out of the ice."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"The shot cuts to a wide shot of the two on their floe; among the large icebergs and tiny floes surrounding them stands a massive, towering shard of ice, its craggy peak rising high above the siblings. Katara gets on her feet again, facing Sokka so that the pointed iceberg is behind her."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,[Indignantly.] So it's my fault?
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,[Annoyed.] I knew I should've left you home! [Cut to a close-up of the siblings; Katara is staring down at her brother in anger while he rants calmly.] Leave it to a girl to screw things up!
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Cut to a close-up of Katara's face as it contorts with fury. The shot cuts to a side view as Katara points accusingly at her brother, who makes no movement as she screams her disgust at him, the floe bobbing lightly up and down."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"You are the most sexist, [She brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of water behind her.] immature, [Hands raised back to her head.] nut brained ... [Swings her arms back down again, creating a slightly larger wave; she raises her hands back to her head during a brief loss for words.] I'm embarrassed [Throwing a hand upward, a short jet of water shoots upward as well.] to be related to you!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"She swings both her hands back forcefully once again and her unconscious waterbending hurls a wave directly into the towering iceberg behind her; with a loud, splitting crack, a hooklike fissure arcs up its surface and out its side, leaving a spray of ice where it ends. Sokka, who wears a somewhat disinterested expression, glances briefly in his sister's direction and sees the iceberg; after a short moment, he does a double-take, his expression morphing into one of terror. The shot cuts to show Katara's outburst from behind Sokka; as she continues with her verbal outburst and arm movements, little chunks of ice from the iceberg splash into the water, unheard and unnoticed by Katara."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"Ever since mom died, [Points to herself.] I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"She emphasizes the last words with a strong swing of her hand, waterbending and deepening the crack in the iceberg. Sokka's terror deepens."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"[Pointing to the iceberg behind her, his voice subdued by fright.] Uh ... Katara ..."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"[Close-up of a rage-fueled Katara as she continues her outburst, a finger pointed in Sokka's face.] I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"As she yells out that last word, she unconsciously waterbends once again, causing two new splits in the chunk of ice."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"[In a screeching voice, his eyes open wide in fear.] Katara, settle down!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"No that's it! I'm done helping you! From now on, you're on your own!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Her last movement is her most agitated and it creates a huge wave which, when it impacts the iceberg, sends a number of fissures to snake their way up the iceberg; one of them reaches the top of the iceberg, splitting it completely in half. Petrified, Sokka gasps for air, and it is only now that Katara turns to look behind her. She gasps and the shot cuts to the iceberg; the two halves begin to fall away from each other and the siblings can be seen through the widening space between them. The shot jumps to the siblings' backs as the two halves collapse into the water; a wave larger than any Katara cast at it radiates outward toward them and they are thrown to the ice as it pushes their floe backward."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"Okay, you've gone from ""weird"" to ""freakish"", [He releases her.] Katara."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,[Astonished.] You mean I did that?
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"[Sarcastically, glancing at her and smirking.] Yep. [Nudging her with his elbow.] Congratulations."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Several small bubbles appear on the surface of the water directly in front of them and a small spot of water begins to glow with a bright bluish hue. An overhead shot shows the spread of the brilliant glow and the bubbles within. Cut to the head-on close-up as the two siblings scramble back in renewed terror from the edge, just as a large, roughly spherical iceberg breaks the surface of the water."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,He's alive! We have to help!
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Before Sokka can grab it, Katara grabs Sokka's club out of its sheath on his back and pulls her hood over her head, heading in the direction of the strange boy sealed in the iceberg. Sokka again reaches out his hand in an attempt to hold Katara back, though she is already running across the ice."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,"Katara, get back here! [He grabs his spear from the ice and runs after Katara, who is already at the ice's edge.] We don't know what that thing is!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Katara hops across the short distance between her floe and the iceberg on five tiny chinks of ice; Sokka, close behind her, does the same. Reaching the iceberg first, Katara repeatedly strikes the iceberg with Sokka's club. On her fifth strike, the club breaks through the surface and a great gust of wind, which escapes from within the iceberg, throws her and her brother back from the side of the dome. Fissures quickly snake their way over the whole iceberg and, in a massive outward explosion, the entire orb of ice destroys itself. A beam of light bursts from the core of the iceberg and rockets into the sky. The camera shows the iceberg from the shallow sea bottom as it emits ripples of light. The scene switches to a group of tiger seals, who erect themselves to growl at the distant beam of light."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Zuko,"Finally! [He turns around to face another person in uniform, who sits at a small table.] Uncle, do you realize what this means?!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Iroh,[He is playing some sort of card game. He answers calmly while looking over the tile he's holding toward his nephew.] I won't get to finish my game?
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Zuko,[Turning around again to face the light.] It means my search is about to come to an end.
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,Iroh sighs uninterestedly and places his tile on the table.
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Zuko,[Gestures at the light while facing his uncle again.] That light came from an incredibly powerful source! [The light dwindles and disappears.] It has to be him!
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Iroh,"[With continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism.] Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. [He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending.] I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. [He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice.] Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Zuko,"[Furiously, still facing Iroh.] I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar! Helmsman, head a course for the light!"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Zuko points in the direction of where the light once was. Iroh calmly continues with his game, placing another tile bearing the airbending symbol on the previous one. As he does, a gust of wind washes over him, shaking his tiles."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Sokka,[Brandishing his spear in defense once again.] Stop!
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"Now standing atop the crater, the figure slowly erects himself and looks down at them, and the two siblings stare back in wonder and fear."

Close-up of the boy as he slowly opens his gray eyes. He gasps in awe as he beholds the Southern Water Tribe girl, who stares at him, in wonder, with deep blue eyes.

1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,[Curiously.] What is it?
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Aang,"[In a clear, happy, hopeful tone.] Will you go penguin sledding with me?"
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Katara,"[Awkwardly.] Uh, sure ... I-I guess."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,,"The camera moves back again to show the threesome at the base of the iceberg. The boy elegantly rises to his feet in one swift motion, surprising the other two. Katara looks at him in awe while Sokka backs away in shock, aiming his spear at him again. Katara glances at him in disbelief."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg,Aang,"[Looking around and rubbing his head, while Katara scrambles on her feet.] What's going on here?"

Quickly, the boy scrambles up the ridge of ice and happily jumps on the head of a large, furry creature that has the same arrow-shaped marking on his forehead as the boy."

Realizing what is about to happen, Aang ducks before Appa sneezes, sending a large blast of green snot flying directly onto Sokka, who becomes completely covered in it. He squeals in disgust and begins to frantically try clean it off, rubbing his face in the snow under the amused gaze of his sister."

1,2,The Avatar Returns,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Avatar_Returns,Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world."
1,2,The Avatar Returns,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Avatar_Returns,,"The episode opens onto the yellowing sky as the flare Aang accidentally launched in the previous episode soars lazily through the air in the distance. The camera pans downward to show the figures of Aang and Katara appearing over the horizon. The Southern Water Tribe villagers have gathered in the snow, waiting for the duo's return. Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara approaching the village and the gathered villagers that stand outside the village walls. The children become overjoyed upon seeing Aang."

1,2,The Avatar Returns,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Avatar_Returns,Katara,[Angrily.] To find a waterbender. Aang is taking me to the North Pole.

Two more blasts are fired his way before he loses his grip on his glider and the object spins away. The staff falls several feet away. Aang ducks, spins and leaps out of the way of blasts and lands on the very ledge, struggling to keep his balance. Zuko hurls more fire blasts his way. Aang holds up his hands in defense, but the last blast seemingly knocks him out cold and he falls backward off the ship into the water, where he slowly sinks.

Katara takes a step back and slowly and precariously bends a stream of water from the puddle, causing the men to slow down and gasp in surprise.

She backs away slowly, but turns around and quickly runs toward Appa. She begins mounting Appa, while Sokka is trying to cut himself free by smashing his icy chains with his boomerang."

Together, they synchronize a firebending move and fire a powerful blast at the bison. Sokka and Katara stare at the incoming attack in horror, while Aang leaps onto the saddle. He opens the small tail wing of his staff and swings his glider around, using a powerful swipe of air to redirect the fireball into a nearby cliff side. The impact causes an avalanche of snow and ice to begin falling. Cut to Zuko, who looks up in horror at the event, raising one arm protectively. The front of the ship becomes buried in a mass of snow and ice, while Appa climbs higher and higher. Switch to a scene of the trio, who laugh as they escape successfully.

1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Zhao,That's quite a bit of damage.
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Zuko,"Yes. [He holds up one finger, while Iroh stares disinterested in front of him.] You wouldn't believe what happened. [He glances at his uncle, and angrily commands him as he gestures at Zhao.] Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened."

[He happily holds his hand up and relates enthusiastically.] It was incredible! [To Zuko, from the corner of his mouth in a confused tone.] What? Did we crash or something?"
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Zuko,[Looks at his uncle uncomfortably.] Yes! Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship!
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Zhao,[In disbelief.] Really? You must regale me with all of the thrilling details. [Smirks while he gets into Zuko's face.] Join me for a drink?
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Zuko,"[He averts his gaze and begins to walk away.] Sorry, but we have to go."
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,,"Zhao smiles evilly at him as he starts to walk away, but after a few steps, Iroh place his hand on his shoulder to hold him back."

[Removes his hand from Zuko's shoulder as he faces Zhao while Zuko just slants his eyes.] We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite."
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,,Iroh and Zhao walk off screen. Zuko grunts in anger upon hearing Iroh's tea comment. He growls angrily and firebends a small arc out of annoyance as he turns to walk after them.
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Sokka,"[Annoyed.] Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food."
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,,"Sokka starts to go through the luggage and gets out a bag. He looks at it for a moment while it sways in the wind. With his tongue out of his mouth full anticipation, he sticks his hand in the bag and starts to go through it. He looks surprised for a moment, but quickly and with anticipation turns the bag upside down to pour the contents into his hand. Close-up of his gloved hand as only a few crumbs of blubbered seal jerky fall into it."
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Sokka,[Accusingly to the two in front of him.] Hey! Who ate all of my blubbered seal jerky?!
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Aang,[Surprised.] Oh. That was food? [Happily.] I used it to start the campfire last night. [The hint of a smile can be heard.] Sorry.
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Sokka,[Shocked.] You what?! [Looks up before slanting his eyes and groans. Longing.] No wonder the flames smelled so good.

1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Katara,"[Uneasily.] Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders."
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Aang,[Cheerfully.] What about 'em?
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Katara,"[Close-up of Katara.] Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. [Sadly.] They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people."
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Aang,"[Ponders over her words for a bit. Hopefully.] Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped!"
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Katara,[Places one hand on Aang's shoulder.] I know it's hard to accept.
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,Aang,"[Cheerfully, as Katara moves her hand back to her side.] You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison! [Caresses Appa's head.] Right, Appa?"
1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,,Appa grunts. The camera moves back to show that Appa flies past to begin a last ascent up the side of a mountain.

Aang looks back for a moment to his passengers. The camera switches to a further off view of Appa as he flies over the rocks and into the sky again.

1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,,Iroh knocks over a weapon display behind them. The weapons come crashing down with a lot of noise. The general cowers at the noise and the damage he wrecked. Zhao turns around looking annoyed.

1,3,The Southern Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Southern_Air_Temple,,Iroh places his hands in his sleeves and walks away backward out of the screen with a faint smile on his face.

[Close-up, as he continues on a softer tone, slightly mockingly.] It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago. [Gets up.] Come on, Uncle, we're going."

He smiles too, as he looks at Sokka from the corners of his eyes. Cut to a shot of Sokka, looking concentrated while standing on a pole and guarding the goal of the airball court. The camera quickly moves back to the other side of the court, where Aang also stands on one of the tall poles, suspending a hollow ball in the air with airbending. He lets the ball roll over his shoulders, tosses it from side to side and lazily tosses it up in the air. He looks and smiles innocently at Sokka with his hands behind his back. Switch to Sokka, who looks surprised at the upward movement of the ball before cutting back to Aang who opens one eye as the ball comes down again. The airbender jumps up and kicks the ball away with a powerful air swipe.

Aang jumps up and lands between two fans of a Kyoshi Warrior that are lying on the ground. He stands up and picks us the fan with his airbending. Close-up of Zuko, who madly charges Aang with his fist already held stretched out before him. Aang spins around a few times to create a bigger momentum and uses the extra power of his swirl to blast Zuko in a nearby house with a strong blast of air. Aang looks sad and lowers the fans. He runs down the main street and picks up his staff along the way. Aang tosses the object in the air, where it snaps open into his glider and jumps on. A close-up of a saddened Aang, switches to the scene he is seeing: a lot of burning houses and the Fire Nation troops among them. Aang looks back to see the burning statue of Avatar Kyoshi, which saddens Aang even more."

1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Bumi,Choose wisely!
1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Aang,I ... choose ... you. [Aang points to the king.]
1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Bumi,Wrong choice!

1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,,The guard tosses Aang his staff. The king bends several rocks at Aang who just avoids and evades the attacks.
1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Bumi,Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.
1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,,The king attacks Aang some more. Aang just keeps avoiding and evading.

1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,,"Aang charges forward on foot again, using airbending to accelerate but the king softens the arena floor, leaving him sunk to the waist. The king bends two stones to collide on the spot but Aang pops out at the top of them when they meet. Visibly angry now, he bends the slab the king is standing on all the way to the back of the arena. The king bends the largest boulder yet to come at Aang from behind but he does an air-assisted back flip over it. The king makes more bending moves, cracking the floors and walls of the arena, tearing out a huge chunk of the wall and balcony they had been standing on. Seeing what is coming, Aang gasps and runs in tight circles, conjuring a tornado. When the king flings the huge piece at Aang, it is caught in the tornado and instantly whips around right back at the king. The king bends it to sand before it can smash him, but before he can recover, Aang attacks from the top of the tornado, landing at the king's feet with his staff poised to strike. The king's arms are raised as if surrendering but a small pebble strikes Aang's head, drawing his attention to the large boulder suspended over the both of them."
1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Bumi,"Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart.

1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Aang,That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.

1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Aang,"Okay. So back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel."

1,5,The King of Omashu,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_King_of_Omashu,Sokka,Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were?

You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius. And it looks like you're in good hands.

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Aang,You must have really inspired him.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,I guess so.

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Unhappily.] Dawn?! Can't we sleep in for once?
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,"[Commandingly.] Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,"[Slyly, with a wry smirk.] I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,[With finality.] Goodnight!
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,Katara and Aang share a few playful chuckles with each other before she blows out the lamplight to get some rest.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Old man,[Points accusingly.] That's him! That's the earthbender!
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,The Fire Nation leader shoves the old man out of the way and approaches Haru. Haru screams as the man forces Haru into his grip and hauls him away.

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Hurriedly.] The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending!
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,"[Steps beside her, taking her hand in his and laying his other hand supportively behind her shoulder.] Slow down, Katara. When did this happen?"
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,"Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,"[Turns defiantly to the open door, clenches fists.] We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Aang,[Confused.] And ... why would they do that?
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Determined.] Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending. [Aang and Sokka share a horrified look.]
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,Scene changes to Sokka and Katara working together to push a boulder overtop an air vent on a rocky road.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,"I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and ta-da! Fake earthbending."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,"[Props hands off hips, turns to Aang.] Aang? Did you get all that?"
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Aang,"[Snapping small puffs of air at a sooty copper fritillary butterfly; dismissively.] Sure, sure. I got it."

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Aang,"[Continues snapping puffs of air; still dismissive.] Yeah, yeah. Just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,"[Aggravated.] By this, do you mean intentionally being captured by a group of ruthless firebenders?"
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Aang,[Humored.] Exactly! That's fun stuff!
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,[Group of firebenders with spears approach.] Here they come! Get in your places!
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"Aang stops playing with the butterfly and Momo tries catching it as it flies away.

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,[Just as angrily hunched over.] What did you call me?
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Far too dramatically as her hair loopies move with her motion.] A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?! [Imitates an elephant's ears.]
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,"[Towers over his sister.] You better back off! [Slips his hand by his mouth and mutters.] Seriously, back off."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,"[More determined, heightens above her now-cowering brother.] I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!"

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"At Katara's shout, Aang gasps quietly as he realizes his mistake by missing his cue. The young airbender ceases playing with the butterfly, leaps up, and blasts a strong jet of air into the ventilation duct, suddenly sending the boulder levitating into the air. This reveals Momo behind the boulder, who has his arms raised, licking himself."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Guard,[Points a finger to the lemur; surprised.] That lemur! He's earthbending!

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"Sokka steps beside Katara, laying his hands on her shoulders as the boulder falls to the ground. Katara stands patiently."

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"Katara is in the back of a Fire Nation transport with other earthbender prisoners. She wears a brown, tattered prison garb over her blue Water Tribe outfit and stares glumly downward.

Katara looks longingly over shoulder as the cart bobs along a pier, heading toward a waiting barge on the ocean."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Sokka,"[Aang stares nervously at the barge carrying Katara to the prison.] She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"After the barge arrives, six prisoners, including Katara, line up on the deck of the prison. Spear-wielding guards stand at either side. A prison warden approaches."

I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, [Quips smartly.] but as honored guests. And I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host. [Paces nonchalantly.] You will succeed here, if you simply abide-"
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"The warden pauses, suddenly interrupted by a prisoner in line coughing. With no forewarning, the warden leaps into the air and aims a blast of fire at the prisoner's legs in anger. The prisoner cowers away for safety as the warden stands defiantly toward the man."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Warden,[Very angrily.] What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him?! Take him below! [Swings his arms. Some guards escort the man away. Mutters.] One week in solitary will improve his manners. [Continues smug gait.] Simply treat me with the courtesy that I give you-
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"Approaches Katara, kneeling to stare into her obstinate expression. She crosses her eyebrows, scowling coarsely at the man."

[Katara pauses, glancing over the expansive ocean to the land far away.] So, if you have any illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people ... [Lowly.] forget them. It is impossible. Good day."

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Somewhat apologetically.] It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Haru,"[Shocked.] So, you got yourself arrested?"
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,It was the only way to find you.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Haru,"You've got guts, Katara. I'll give you that. [Places hand on her shoulder.] Come on. There's someone I want you to meet."

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Slightly bows.] It's an honor to meet you.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Tyro,"[Hands Katara a bowl.] Have some dinner, Katara. [Katara accepts the bowl, but grimaces.] It's not as bad as it looks. [Katara tries a spoonful, but becomes further disgusted. He finds humor in this with a small chuckle.] It's still pretty bad though."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Prisoner,[Walks up and lays a hand on Tyro's shoulder.] Tyro. The prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Tyro,"I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather."

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Tyro,The plan? The plan is to survive. Wait out this war. Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Shocked.] How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up!
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Tyro,"Katara, I admire your courage. And I envy your youth. But people's lives are at stake here. The warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless."
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Katara,[Obstinately.] We'll see about that.
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,"Katara stands up and carries a trash can lid and a ladle, climbing on top of a wooden table. From there, she bangs the ladle against the lid to draw attention."

Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. [The watchman walks up to talk the warden, but the warden stops him and listens.] Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders, [Shouts clearly.] let us fight for our freedom!"

1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Captain,"Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point, is it, sir?"
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,Warden,"[Furiously.] I'll decide what the point is, fool!"
1,6,Imprisoned,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Imprisoned,,The warden throws the first guard overboard. The man screams in horror before finally being silenced by a splash below.

1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,[Worriedly.] It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Sokka,"[In a sarcastic, amused tone while facing Aang.] Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,[Frightfully.] I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,"[Grabs Aang's arm.] Calm down, it's going to be okay. [Aang sits down in front of her.] If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,[Smiling.] You'd do that?
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,[Nods and looks over the side of Appa's saddle.] We'll need to find a good source of water first.
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Sokka,[Grinning; sarcastically.] Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,,"Cuts to Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo standing in front of a large waterfall and river."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Sokka,[Frowning beside Aang and Katara's ecstatic faces.] Nice puddle.

1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,[Somewhat blankly.] Remember the reason we're here.
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,[Stops short and looks at Katara.] Oh right. Time to practice waterbending. [Puts his clothes back on.]
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Sokka,[Sarcastically.] Great. So what am I supposed to do?
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes. [Hands Sokka a branch with a bushel of leaves at the end.]

1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Sokka,Okay. [Takes stick and walks over to Appa who is floating in the water.]

1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Zuko,[Hopefully.] Is it something to do with the Avatar?
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Iroh,"Even more urgent. It seems, I- [Rubs forehead in stress.] -I have lost my lotus tile. [Moves a piece of his across the Pai Sho board.]"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Zuko,[Confused.] Lotus tile?
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Iroh,"For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Zuko,[In disbelief.] You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Iroh,"See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. [Excitedly.] Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life.

1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,"This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away. [She moves her hands back and forth and makes small waves in the water, while Aang looks up, smiling.] Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,"[Stands up.] Like this? [Does the hand movements Katara is doing, but nothing is happening yet.]"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,[Kindly.] That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm sure eventuallyâ
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,"Hey, I'm bending it already! [Shows Aang making much bigger waves than Katara's on his first try.]"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,"[Surprised.] Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,"[Shrugs shoulders.] Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,[Smiles.] Thanks.
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,"So, what's next?"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,"This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water. [She moves her hands and raises a stream of water from the river into the air and moves it around.] It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- [Shows Aang already controlling a stream of water, moving it around and above his body and neatly coiling it back into the river, much to Katara's dismay.] Nice work. [She frowns.] Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary."
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,"Sorry. [Excited.] Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming!"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,"[Looks up sadly.] Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave. [She moves her hands up, shaking, and starts to get a big mass of water to rise out of the river, but it pops before forming into anything substantial.]"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,"So, like this? [He raises his hands and creates a massive wave that towers over their heads.]"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Sokka,"[Still working on cleaning up Appa, he looks up and stares at Aang's wave crashing toward him in fear.] Aang?! [The wave throws Sokka off into the water and his head slowly rises out, annoyed.]"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,[Smiling.] Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got?
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Katara,[Angry at Aang's quick success.] That's enough practicing for today.
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Sokka,"[Head still sticking out of the water.] Yeah, I'll say! [Points to the left.] You just ""practiced"" our supplies down the river. [Shows a group of bags floating away.]"
1,9,The Waterbending Scroll,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Waterbending_Scroll,Aang,"[Looking guilty.] Uh, sorry. [Smiles worriedly.] I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,Run! [They turn to run but a firebender blocks them off by setting the plants behind them on fire.] We're cut off!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"Sokka, your shirt! [Sokka yells; Katara clears a fire on Sokka's shirt with waterbending.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,[Whispers.] What are you doing?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,[Whispers.] Bluffing?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Eye-patch soldier,You promise not to hurt us? [He's somehow knocked out.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"Nice work, Sokka! How'd you do that?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"Uh, instinct?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,[Points up a tree.] Look!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"In a tree, a man with hook swords, Jet, jumps and takes down two soldiers. He runs forward and takes down two more using his hook swords."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Down you go. [Katara looks amazed, Aang shocked, and Sokka confused.]"

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Fire Nation soldier,They're in the trees!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"A young boy lands on top of the soldier and turns his helmet around to blind him, before riding him around while laughing. Another boy launches arrows at the soldiers while more boys come out of the trees. Aang and Katara are shown fighting the soldiers. Sokka holds up his boomerang and yells as one approaches him, but stops when Jet takes him down first."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"Hey, he was mine!"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Gotta be quicker next time.

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Hey.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,Hi.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,They look around to see a now empty camp
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,[Amazed.] You just took out a whole army almost single-handed.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"[Disdainfully.] Army? There were only like, twenty guys."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters, Sneers, Longshot, Smellerbee, The Duke, and Pipsqueak."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"[Laughing; looking at The Duke.] Ha, ha, Pipsqueak, that's a funny name. [The Duke sniffs his nose, as the camera pans upward to Pipsqueak.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Pipsqueak,"[Looming over Aang in a threatening manner; in a low, growling tone of voice.] You think my name is funny?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,[Side-shot; Aang looks taken aback for a second before replying in an upbeat tone.] It's hilarious!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Facial shot of Pipsqueak, still looming forward with a frown on his face. He suddenly starts laughing. The camera moves back, showing Aang and The Duke following suit. Pipsqueak pats the Avatar on the back in a friendly manner, though the hit was hard enough to knock Aang flat on the ground. The Duke stops laughing and looks down at Aang sprawled on the ground before his feet, face flat in the dirt, though when Aang raises his head and continues laughing, so does The Duke."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"[Approaching Jet.] Umm, thanks for saving us Jet. We're lucky you were there."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning, we just needed the right distraction, and then you guys stumbled in."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,[Eyeing Sokka.] We were relying on instincts.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,You'll get yourself killed doing that.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,Sokka looks at them disdainfully as The Duke and Pipsqueak look through the barrels.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),The Duke,"Hey Jet, these barrels are filled of blasting jelly."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,That's a great score.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Pipsqueak,And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Also good, let's not get those mixed up."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),The Duke,We'll take this stuff back to the hideout.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,You guys have a hideout?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,You wanna see it?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"[Very excitedly.] Yes, we wanna see it!"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,Jet smiles at her and the camera fades to show them standing on the forest floor.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,We're here.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,Where? There's nothing here.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Hold this. [Gives a rope to Sokka.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,[Skeptically.] Why? What's this do? [Screams as he is pulled up into the branches.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Aang? [Offers Aang another rope.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,I'll get up on my own. [Leaps up into the trees with airbending.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Grab hold of me, Katara."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Katara blushes as she takes his hand and they rise up through the tree together in a romantic setting. They come to a landing on a wooden platform in the trees. Once up there, Aang is seen zip lining through the trees."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,[While passing through with Momo.] Nice place you got!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,It's beautiful up here!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,It's beautiful ... and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us. [Smellerbee lands near the two.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Smellerbee,"They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,[As Aang zips by again.] Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble. See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Pipsqueak,"We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines, and doing anything we can to mess with 'em. [Sokka is now seen comically hopping around trying to get past Pipsqueak.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,That's so brave. [Sokka manages to get by Pipsqueak.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"[Sarcastically.] Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a tree house."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,Don't pay any attention to my brother.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,No problem. He probably had a rough day.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"So, you all live here? [Sokka who is being ignored comically sinks back behind them.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,That's right. Longshot over there? [The screen cuts to Longshot and The Duke walking not making a sound.] His town got burned down by the Fire Nation. And we found The Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,What about you?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,[Katara and Jet come to a halt as the rest pass.] The Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"I'm so sorry, Katara."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"The screen fades from the two of them alone on the suspension bridge to the blue sky above the canopy. A cloud of cawing birds is disturbed as Appa raises his head with a roar. In the hideout, ropes with lanterns hang between branches. Sentries keep watch on several upper platforms while the group sits at a banquet table. While the group eats, Jet stands on the table."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine. [Everyone cheers. Katara and Aang smile while Sokka cops an attitude and a scowling face.] I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face, when The Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey. [The Duke, without his helmet, climbs up the table. He marches on the table with his arms in the air.] Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids hiding in the trees. [He prepares to take a drink from his wooden cup.] Maybe they're right. [A very loud and long boo is heard; with an angry face.] Or maybe ... they're dead wrong. [A loud and long cheer is heard.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"Hey Jet, nice speech."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That was some great bending I saw out there today."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. [Blushes.] I could use some more training."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Avatar huh? Very nice.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,Thanks Jet.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"Unfortunately, we have to leave tonight. [Sokka starts walking away.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow. [Sokka turns around.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,What mission?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,The scene changes to the top of the forest the next day. Jet and Sokka are in branches of the same tree. Jet cups his hands and makes a birdcall; several trees down Pipsqueak and Smellerbee step into view from their branches. They reply with another birdcall. Sokka jams his jawbone knife into the trunk of the tree
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,What are you doing?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,Shh ... It amplifies vibrations.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,[Impressed.] Good trick.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"[Sokka puts his ear to the handle of his knife.] Nothing yet. [Whispers.] Wait! Yes, someone's approaching."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,[Whispers.] How many?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,I think there's just one.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"[Does a another birdcall.] Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon. [Sokka takes his knife out of the tree. His eyes spot an old man.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"[Whispers.] Wait, false alarm ... He's just an old man."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Jet ignores Sokka and prepares to attack the old man, leaping to the ground in front of the traveler. Sokka watches with horror."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"What are you doing in our woods, you leech?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Old Fire Nation civilian,"Please sir, I'm just a traveler."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Jet takes a step, and with one swipe, sends the man's cane flying from his hand. The old man backs away, but when he tries to flee the way he came, he runs face first into Pipsqueak's chest. The force of the impact knocks him to the ground; Pipsqueak looms over him. He tries to crawl away, but Pipsqueak's foot on his backside effectively pins him."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Old Fire Nation civilian,Oh ... Please let me go ... have mercy ...
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Does the Fire Nation let people go? Does the Fire Nation have mercy?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Jet is about to kick the man, but his foot is snagged by Sokka's club before it can be delivered. Sokka releases him."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"Jet, he's just an old man!"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,He's Fire Nation! Search him! [Pipsqueak holds the prisoner and Smellerbee steps up to search the poor man.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,But he's not hurting anyone!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Smellerbee,"We've got his stuff, Jet. [She holds up the old man's bag. The old man is thrown back on the ground.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,This doesn't feel right.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"It's what has to be done, now let's get outta here."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,Jet pushes past Sokka. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow. Sokka looks at the old man still on his hands and knees in pity.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Come on, Sokka!"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Sokka slowly turns and runs to catch up with the others. At the hideout, Aang and Momo are playing with the ziplines again. He leaps near Sokka."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me! [Aang is wearing a bag and pulls a small pellet from it. With a sly grin, he tosses it next to Momo, where it explodes with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He hisses and lunges for the bag. Momo sits on Aang's shoulder and tosses several pellets at his feet. Aang dances about wildly.] Ow! Quit it!"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Sokka is oblivious of it all. He's sitting with his back to the trunk and staring at the ground, glaring. Katara walks up."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,Yeah he's back. But we're leaving.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,What?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,But I made him this hat. [She shows a cap made out of stitched leaves with a flower on top.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"What? No, he's not."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,He's messed up Katara.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life, a really fun way of life."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,He beat and robbed a harmless old man!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,I wanna hear Jet's side of the story. [The scene changes to Jet in a room.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Sokka, you told them what happened, but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Jet is sitting on a hammock-bed, the others stand. Sokka stands grumpily as far away as he can get. Aang is wearing the hat Katara made; he looks ridiculous and goofy."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"No, he conveniently left that part out."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian!"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"He was an assassin, Sokka."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Jet pulls out a knife and thrusts it into a nearby stump. It is a sinister looking curved blade. There are four spikes evenly spaced along the grip, with enough space for fingers to go between them. There is a ring on the butt of the knife."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. [He pulls on the ring and removes a small glass tube filled with red liquid.]. He was sent to eliminate me; you helped save my life, Sokka."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,I knew there was an explanation.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,I didn't see any knife!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,That's because he was concealing it.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"See, Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. [Sokka stomps away.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,What can we do?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use waterbending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,Aang and Katara look at each other. Fade to them entering their hut. Sokka is tying up a mat on the floor.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinctâ"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"Sorry, Sokka."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"They leave the hut. Fade to the night sky above the canopy. A full moon shines on Appa, who is on his back and snoring extremely loud as he sleeps. Inside the Trio's hut, Sokka sleeps propped up against his still-packed gear while the others sleep in their sleeping bags."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Let's go.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Sokka wakes up. He pulls the door flap aside enough to see some of Jet's followers descending on the rope lines. Sokka grabs a rope line down to a lower branch. On the ground below him, Jet's Freedom Fighters are quietly pushing the loaded wagon as Jet leads them out of the camp. Sokka stealthily follows. In the dark valley. Upstream, and up toward the wall of the valley there is an old falls, and beyond that a man-made dam. A bare cliff off to the reservoir's left provides the view. Jet and his boys emerge from the forest. He goes to the edge and looks down on the dam below. The reservoir behind it is low. He turns back to the wagon."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Now listen, you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive. [The Duke jumps off the wagon.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),The Duke,"But what about the people in the town, won't they get wiped out too? [Jet places a hand on The Duke's shoulder.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. [To Longshot.] Now don't blow the dam until I give the signalâgot it? [Longshot nods.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Sokka watches incredulously from the bushes. He frowns, and hears rustling just before Pipsqueak drags him out by his wolf-tail. Smellerbee's knife is instantly at his throat."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Jet, standing near the edge of the cliff. As he watches, Pipsqueak and Smellerbee drag Sokka between them. Pipsqueak still has a handful of Sokka's wolf-tail."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Sokka, I'm glad you decided to join us. [Pipsqueak and Smellerbee send Sokka to his knees. He rubs his shoulder.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,"There are people living there, Jet; mothers and fathers and children."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Sokka,I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"The screen pans to the riverside upriver from the dam. The collected water behind it is much less than the larger cavity of the reservoir. The river leading to down to it is a thread compared to its 'rainy season' gully. Jet, Katara, and Aang are seen walking upriver along its west bank."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"Jet, I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"No worries, he already apologized."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,Really? [Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.] Sokka apologized?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Yeah, I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"Yeah, I did."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Katara. You can do this.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,[Airbends himself back on the ground.] What about me?
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,I know the Avatar can do this.

After a few minutes, a stream of water emerges from the hole. They pull it to their height and send it toward the river where it continues to flow like a waterfall. The water quickly joins the river."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Yes! Good job! This river empties into the reservoir--a few more geysers and it'll be full.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"Look, there's another steam vent. [Aang and Katara walk off in its direction.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Okay. You two keep it up, I'll go check on things at the reservoir. [He turns and walks away.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,When we're done we'll meet you over there.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,Actually ... probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done. [Jet resumes walking away Aang and Katara bend the next geyser into another fountain.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,"[Later.] I bet that's enough, and I'm not just saying that to be lazy. [Around them, over a dozen geysers flow into the river.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"Well, we finished early. I'm sure he'll be happy to see us."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"The screen changes to a path in the forest. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow Sokka, who has his hands tied behind his back. Smellerbee gives Sokka a shove; Sokka stumbles but remains on his feet."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Katara and Aang are standing on the edge of the cliff. At the base of the dam, four of Jet's people are unloading barrels from the wagon and arranging them."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"What? No, that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that. [Aang opens his glider.]"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Aang,I've gotta stop him. [He takes off.]
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,[Less convinced.] Jet wouldn't do that.
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Before Aang can reach the edge, Jet crosses his path from behind and snatches the glider. Aang is left wobbling precariously on the edge, and uses airbending to get himself back on stable footing."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Katara,"Jet, why?"
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),Jet,"Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother, we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again."

1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"Aang's closed glider is on the ground. As he reaches for it, one of Jet's hook swords pins it. Jet has the two swords hook to hook; with a yank he pulls Aang's glider to him."

Jet attacks; Aang defends himself with balls of air, which Jet ducks. Jet attacks head on, but Aang blocks with his arms and sends his opponent flying into a tree trunk with an air kick. Jet combines his swords again and advances. Aang avoids the flail-like move and sends another air blast. Jet stoops down and lets the air flow over and past him before lunging."
1,10,Jet,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Jet_(episode),,"They continue the chase through the many levels of the forest. Jet catches up to Aang and sends them both freefalling, attacking as they go. They both end up on a branch. Jet continues his attack. Aang avoids it all. Jet charges again, but Aang hits him with a jetstream of air. Jet falls. He recovers, but loses the glider in the process. Before Aang can get to the ground Jet kicks him into a trunk. He lands with a thud next to his glider."

Before Jet can take more than a step however, he his hit by a large water strike. Katara is there; she uses water from the river to throw Jet against the trunk of the tree.

The wall and gate are swallowed as the wave strikes the town. The flotsam carried away includes a smiling doll in a purple dress."

[The flashback ends and the townsfolk are seen on high ground above the river, on the bank opposite the town.

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Zhang leader,Sick people get priority over old people.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves!
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Zhang leader,We wouldn't travel with those pompous fools anyway! [The two tribes begin to shout at each other again.]

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,[Dismayed.] His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it? [Cut to an overhead wide shot of the two tribes and the others.]
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Canyon guide,"Okay, now comes the bad news. [Cut to a frontal shot of the guide.] No food allowed in the canyon, it attracts [He makes motions with his hands to illustrate the skittery monsters that might lurk in the canyon.] dangerous predators. [Both tribes yell out in protest.]"
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin Leader,No food?! This is ridiculous.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Canyon guide,"Oh, you babies can go a day without food? Would you rather be hungry, or dead? [He raises an earth pillar to tower over the rest. He continues, cupping his hands to his mouth to amplify his voice.] Now, we're heading down in ten minutes.

[To Appa.] See you on the other side, buddy! Yip yip! [Appa roars and takes off. The camera fades to show both groups of people climbing down into the canyon. The tour guide earthbends to form a bridge in a gap in the path.]"
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,Nice bending!
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Canyon guide,"The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. [Turns to the travelers.] Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice."
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,,"Katara and Sokka look up in fear as an avalanche of rocks comes falling toward them, and the canyon guide earthbends it away from them."

Katara, Aang, and Sokka look at each other in exasperation and the scene fades to show them standing at the bottom of the canyon next to a huge boulder."

[He throws his boomerang at the crawler, which drops the canyon guide and comes after Sokka instead.] Okay, now we gotta help me!

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,[To the canyon guide.] What was that?
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Canyon guide,[On the ground.] Canyon crawler. [Groans in pain.] And there's sure to be more!

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,It's the Zhangs! They took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Zhang leader,"What? If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins!"
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,I hope you're happy. We're stuck in this canyon with no way out.

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,Now there's something we can agree on.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,[To the canyon guide.] Any ideas?
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Canyon guide,No bendng ... we need to get out of this canyon ... I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Zhang leader,"Sure, unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!"
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,Gladly.

[Jumps onto a tall rock.] We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. [The two leaders nod at each other and start walking. Aang jumps down to Sokka and Katara.] Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much."

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Zhang leader,What for? Its the dry season.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,Exactly!

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Katara,So it was you guys who had food!
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,"Oh come now, you really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?"

[Fades to show a large gate with a finely dressed man running toward it. Voice-over.] The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb. [Camera goes back to the Gan Jin leader's face.] Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang."

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Zhang leader,"The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in."
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,[Still eating.] Hmm.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Zhang leader,"Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years. [Fades to show a poorly-dressed man running through a large gate. Voice-over.] Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison. [Back to Zhang leader.] We Zhangs will never forget that injustice."
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,That's just terrible. [Looks at her piece of meat.] You gonna finish that?

Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts!

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,"Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin."
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Katara,Not punished enough if you ask me.

I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. [Scene fades to show the two men facing each other. Voice-over.] There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes. [Fades back to Aang.] There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game."

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin man,What about our tribe's redemption ritual?
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,"That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell ""redemption""!

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,[Bowing.] And look to the future.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,,The Zhang leader bows back and Aang looks at them happily. The scene fades to show them standing with Appa.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,"Good to see you, boy. Did you miss me? [Appa licks Aang as the Gan Jin leader approaches.]"
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,"I cannot thank you enough, Avatar."
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,"[Covered in Appa's slobber.] Well, you know I try."
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Gan Jin leader,[Recoils in disgust.] Ugh!

1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,You could call it luck. Or you could call it lying.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Sokka,[Flabbergasted.] What?
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Aang,I made the whole thing up.
1,11,The Great Divide,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Great_Divide,Katara,[Shocked.] You did not! [In devilish admiration.] That is so wrong.

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"The episode begins in Aang's dream. The scene itself, dominated by a tinge of warm yellow, is filled with clouds for a moment before Aang slides into the frame of the shot, his face happy as he flicks the reins. The shot switches to a far view, showing that he is riding Appa, who is flapping his six legs in unison up and down as if he were a bird. The camera pans to the right, revealing Sokka as he pulls alongside Appa, using Aang's glider to fly with the Avatar. The shot cuts to a close-up of the Water Tribe warrior as he turns his head toward Aang, grinning broadly and contentedly at him. Cut to Aang as his face exhibits the same contented grin. He turns his attention to his right and the camera follows his gaze, revealing Katara sitting atop the head of an enormous Momo; she waves at Aang. Camera moves back to a wide frontal shot of the group coursing leisurely through the open sky."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"[Voice-over.] We need you, Aang."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"[Close-up as he is looking toward Katara; contentedly.] I need you, too."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Aang notices something out of the corner of his eyes. As he turns toward it, his expression changes to shock. Focusing on Aang's face, the camera turns 180 degrees and switches to his point of view as the sky's coloring changes to a dark, ominous gray, revealing a churning storm cloud before him. Cut back to Aang, who yanks Appa's reins in fright."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"[Alarmed.] Be careful, guys! [He looks to his left and right, uneasy.] Guys?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"The scene rapidly zooms out, revealing that Aang and Appa are alone, surrounded by nothing but the darkening sky. Cut back to Aang's point of view as Gyatso, in lotus, floats downward, positioning himself in front of Aang."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,[Surprised.] Gyatso?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,"[Whispering, his tone sad.] Why did you disappear?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,[Frontal shot; his voice soft and sad.] I didn't mean to.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Cut to a side-view of the two monks, not a meter apart from one another. Aang reaches out to Gyatso, but before he can touch him, Gyatso turns gray and dissipates into smoke; it blows over Aang, causing him to raise his left arm in front of his face and turn away to shield himself from it. Frontal shot of Aang as the last of the smoke washes over him. He peeks over his arm, but instantly raises his head, his eyes growing big in shock; a dark shadow passes over him as the shot cuts to a distant side-view of Appa being swallowed by the dark cloud."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,"[Voice-over.] We need you, Aang."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"A bolt of lightning splits the shot for an instant before cutting to a frontal shot of a screaming and frightened Aang, wrestling with the reins, as he and Appa are caught in the belly of the storm with rain beating down on them. Cut to an underwater shot as Aang and Appa plummet into the ocean. The duo floats for a moment. Cut to a close-up of Aang's hand as his grip on Appa's reins loosens and they slip from his limp grasp."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso and Katara,"[Echoing voice-over.] We need you, Aang. [Cut to a downward view of an unconscious Aang sinking.] We need you. We need you, Aang. We need you."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Unmoving, Aang sinks and disappears into the darkness of the ocean. For a fraction of a second, lightning splits the shot once again and the silhouette of the Fire Lord surrounded by flames appears."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,[Drowsily.] What's going on? [He looks around.] Did we get captured again?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"[Shot looking down, sliding right; Aang turns to his friends.] It's nothing. I just had a bad dream. [He curls up, facing away from them.] Go back to sleep."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,"[Curls up, facing away from Aang.] Don't have to tell me twice."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"[Frontal shot of Aang with Katara behind him, looking at him in concern.] Are you all right, Aang?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,[Looking lost.] I'm okay.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,[Briefly closing his eyes.] I think I just need some rest.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,"[Sitting up behind Katara; upbeat.] You guys want to hear about my dream? [Katara glares at him, an expression Sokka returns.] That's okay. I didn't want to talk about it anyway."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Sokka lies down, disappearing from view; Katara does the same."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"Look at those clear skies, buddy! [Pets Appa's head. Cut to a close shot as he looks up at a flock of birds arranged in a ""V"" flying overhead, their goose-like honking audible.] Should be some smooth flying."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Cut to an overhead shot looking down of Katara looking into a bag before holding it upside down, sprinkling the ground with crumbs; Momo instantly eats them. Sokka walks past her toward Appa, carrying some of their luggage."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"[Looking from the contents of the bag up to Aang.] Well, we better smoothly fly [She steps onto Appa's tail and walks to the saddle.] ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,"[Side-shot as he suddenly straightens up, his tone serious.] Guys, wait. This was in my dream. [Momo lands on the pack behind him.] We shouldn't go to the market."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"[Shot cuts beside Sokka, facing out toward Katara and Aang, who turn to look at him; curious.] What happened in your dream?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,"[Frontal shot; his eyes are bugged out in terror and the camera zooms in on him, rolling slightly as the shot takes on a greenish tint and alien music dubs the scene.] Food eats people! [The colors return to normal as the shot cuts to Katara's face as she shakes her head. Behind her, Aang goes back to adjusting the reins. Cut to Sokka again as he points at Momo.] Also, Momo could talk. [He glares at Momo while crossing his arms.] You said some very unkind things."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Momo's ears droop as Sokka speaks. Cut to downward looking shot of a flock of birds in V-formation flying over the open ocean. As the scene pans to the left, Zuko's ship sails into view. Cut to the deck, where Iroh stands on the deck, with Zuko looking through a spyglass behind him. As the flight of birds passes over Iroh's head in the distance, he sniffs the air and Zuko lowers the spyglass to turn to his uncle, who speaks."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,There is a storm coming. A big one.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Zuko,"You're out of your mind, Uncle. [Walking up to Iroh.] The weather's perfect. There's not a cloud in sight."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"The shot cuts behind the two, facing the prow of the ship and showing a clear sea and sky."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,A storm is approaching from the north. [He turns to face Zuko.] I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Zuko,"[Taking a few steps in Iroh's direction, pointing briefly northward.] We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"[Cut to his face; stern.] Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Zuko,[Cut to his face as he advances on his uncle angrily.] The safety of the crew doesn't matter!
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Behind them, Lieutenant Jee walks onto deck, inadvertently overhearing the conversation. As Zuko realizes Jee is behind him and turns to face him, his expression briefly loses its raging intensity. A quick close-up shows Jee raising an eyebrow as Zuko walks over to him; another cut shifts the view to the lieutenant's side as Zuko, addressing Jee directly, struts up to him, dominantly looking him right in the eyes from a close distance as he finishes speaking."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Zuko,Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"As Zuko walks away, Jee glares after him. The shot switches, showing Zuko leaving the deck through the door at the base of the superstructure. Cut to a frontal shot of Jee, who looks slightly enraged as Iroh walks over to him."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"[Reassuringly, a twinge of uncertainty in his voice, almost as if he does not fully believe what he is saying.] He doesn't mean that. He's just all worked up."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"The scene changes to a seaside hamlet built on the side of a cliff face, the roofs all teal-green; a collection of houses sits back from the waterfront, where a row of warehouses adjoins the docks. Among the several ships moored on the town's four piers is Appa, floating in the water by himself. Cut to Katara, who stands in front of a small merchants' stand, suspiciously eying a watermelon."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Merchant woman,"[Scowling.] Ahhh, it's good. It's perfect, I'm telling you!"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"[Shaking the watermelon, which emits an audible sloshing sound.] I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Merchant woman,"[As the shot zooms out, the merchant moves around the stand where Katara stands. Sokka and Aang, staff in hand, stand beside them; the former is filling a basket with fruit.] Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"[Taking a step toward Katara.] I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"[As the shot cuts to a frontal view of her, she puts the melon back on the stand.] I just realized we're out of money anyway."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Shopkeeper,"[Annoyed, grabbing a basket full of fruits from Sokka.] Awww!"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"As Sokka walks past the merchant, she indignantly kicks him in the rear, drawing a cry of pain from Sokka. Cut to Sokka, Katara, and Aang on the docks. Sokka is rubbing where the lady kicked him and seems downcast."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"You could get a job, smart guy."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"A fisherman and his wife are walking behind the gang. As Katara finishes, they begin a loud, heated conversation, which is overheard easily by Aang, Katara, and Sokka."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman's wife,"We shouldn't go out there! Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm. [Camera cuts to show Aang, who appears alarmed by the prediction.]"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"You're crazy. It's a nice day: [Gesturing to the sky with both arms.] No clouds, no winds, no nothing. So quit your nagging, woman."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,[Nervously suggesting to Katara and Sokka.] Maybe we should find some shelter?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,[Indicating the fair weather.] Are you kidding? Shelter from what?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman's wife,My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"Well, it's your joints against my brain."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman's wife,"Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get! [Cut to a side shot of the couple, showing Sokka running up to them.] How do you like that?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,"[Interrupting, raising his hand.] I'll go."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"You're hired! [Shoots a triumphant look at his wife, who scowls back.]"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,"[After a short pause, to Katara and Aang.] What? You said get a job ... and he's paying double."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"[Rounding on Sokka, his expression wild.] Double? Who told you that nonsense?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"The scene changes to Zuko's ship on the open ocean. As the shot pans right, a massive bank of darkening clouds, having appeared seemingly out of nowhere, rolls into view, looming in front of the ship. Cut to the deck, where Lieutenant Jee and several other soldiers stand a short distance from the shot, staring at the clouds. Zuko walks into the foreground, regarding the clouds as Jee and the others turn to face him. Iroh walks between Zuko and Jee as the latter taunts the former."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Lieutenant Jee,Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,[Pleasantly.] Lucky guess.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Zuko,"[Whirling around and walking toward Jee; angry.] Lieutenant! You'd better learn some respect [Jabs two fingers into Jee's chest.] â or I will teach it to you. [Begins to walk away from Jee, who follows Zuko with his eyes, continuing his taunting after a short pause.]"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Jee,"What do you know about respect? [Behind Jee, Iroh's expression turns to panic and he makes a cutting motion at his throat with his hand, trying to signal Lieutenant Jee to stop. Cut to Zuko's back as he stops walking before switching to his face as he listens to Jee's words.] The way you talk to everyone around here, from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle, shows you know nothing about respect! [Cut to a close-up of Iroh's face as he gasps slightly, reaching out a hand in desperation before moving it to his forehead in resignation, believing Jee has gone too far. Cut back to Zuko's face, contorted with rage.] You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,Zuko turns around and extends his right arm as if preparing to firebend. Lieutenant Jee does the same.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"Easy now. [Both Zuko and Jee wrist-block the other's arm; smoke rises from a furious Zuko's hand. Interrupting the staredown, Iroh extends an arm and pulls theirs apart; the smoke fades.] Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,Lieutenant Jee walks away.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Zuko,I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Iroh puts a comforting hand on Zuko's right shoulder, but Zuko shrugs it off and walks away. Scene changes back to a dock at the fishing town, where Team Avatar stands. Sokka is carrying supplies onto the fisherman's boat."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,I said I was going to do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman's wife,The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"Boy with tattoos? [The fisherman turns around to look at Aang.] Airbender tattoos. Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle. You're the Avatar, ain't ya?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,That's right. [Katara and Aang smile.]
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"Well, don't be so smiley about it. [Katara and Aang frown now.] The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world!"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"Oh, he wouldn't, huh? Then I guess I just have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering. [Aang's eyes widen.]"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. [Behind Katara's back, Aang slowly begins to backpedal away from her.] It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? [Katara turns around to see Aang backing away.] Aang, what's wrong?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"A look of shock and horrified guilt on his face, Aang opens his glider and vaults into the air, rapidly disappearing into the distance."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,That's right! Keep flying!
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"You're a horrible old man! [She gets on Appa, who is floating beside the dock.] Appa, yip yip!"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"As Appa flies out of the water, a big wave splashes the fisherman. Sokka walks out from below deck on the boat."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"Your friends ain't too polite, are they?"

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"[Hands Sokka a crate, interrupting him impolitely.] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck!"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Scene changes to show Katara riding on Appa in the rain, trying to find Aang.

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,[Speaks in a sad voice.] I don't want to talk about it.

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"Well, it's kind of a long story."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,How do you know it's me?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Tashi,We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Monk Tashi airbends a wrapped-up mat to Aang. It opens up, revealing four toys."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little! [He picks up the propeller toy.]
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Tashi,"You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,I just chose them because they seemed fun.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"He smiles and pulls the cord on the propeller toy, sending the propeller spinning into the air. It spins through the air and the scene cuts back to a close view of the five monks. The toy goes over Monk Tashi's head."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Tashi,You chose them because they were familiar.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,"Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned sixteen, but there are troubling signs. Storm clouds are gathering."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Pasang,"I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,"We need you, Aang."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Aang lowers his head, his responsibility crushing him.

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Jee,"I'm sick of taking his orders! I'm tired of chasing his Avatar! I mean, who does Zuko think he is?"

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,[Massages his beard.]Â Try to understand. My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"[Places his hands on Zuko's shoulders.]Â Prince Zuko, what's wrong?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Young Zuko,I want to go into the war chamber [Points to the guard.]Â but the guard won't let me pass!
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"[Leads Zuko away with his left hand still on his shoulder.]Â You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Young Zuko,"If I'm going to rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"Very well. But you must promise not to speak. [Another elder soldier walks by them into the war chamber.]Â These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Young Zuko,"[Bows to Iroh.]Â Thank you, Uncle."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,Zuko and Iroh walk into the war room. The meeting starts.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Bujing,The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here. [Bujing shows the place on the map.] A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors. So I am recommending the forty-first division.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Elder soldier,But the forty-first is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Bujing,I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait than fresh meat?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Young Zuko,[Zuko is shown standing up.] You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Camera shows everyone in the war room staring at Zuko, save for Iroh, who is kneeling behind his nephew. The scene changes back to the present time."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"Zuko was right, you see, [Massages his beard again.]Â but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences.Â [Slightly bows his head.]"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,Scene changes back to Aang and Katara.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Air Nomad boy #2,Not only that! We made up a game you can play with the air scooters!
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,Great! [Aang is shown making his own. But everyone else makes theirs vanish.] What's going on?
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Air Nomad boy #1,"Now that you're the Avatar, it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play?"
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Air Nomad boy #1,That's the only fair way.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"Oh, okay."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,What do you mean?

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,Gyatso and Aang laugh. Monk Tashi appears.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Tashi,You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training!
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,Aang has already trained enough for today.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Tashi,Time is short. [To Aang.] Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,"No. As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Tashi,Hmph.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Monk Tashi is shown walking away. The flashback ends, and the scene changes to on Zuko's ship. A flashback appears of the fire in front of the Fire Lord's throne rising."

[Flashback quickly ends.] He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Jee,Agni Kai. A fire duel.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. [Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing for the Agni Kai.] When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. [Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground.] Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. [Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes to one of fear.] Zuko would have to duel his own father."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Cut to a wall of the cave. The shot pans down to show Katara and a sad-looking Aang around their campfire. While Momo is asleep in his lap, Aang stares off into the fire with unseeing eyes as he continues his story."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Tashi,You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Pasang,"Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Gyatso,All I want is what is best for him.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Pasang,But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Aang is shown looking through a hole in the ceiling, shocked at the news that he just heard."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,"Well, that's not exactly what happened. [Flashback starts again, showing Aang looking out the window of his bedroom.] I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Aang,The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world!
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,"You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders."

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Jee,I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,"It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Jee,So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Iroh,Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Katara,I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Fisherman,"And if you weren't here now, well, I guess I wouldn't be either. Thank you for saving my life, Avatar."
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,Sokka,Do you hear that? It stopped raining.
1,12,The Storm,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Storm,,"Everyone goes outside. Appa shakes raindrops off himself, splashing everyone."

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,"The scene opens on a messenger hawk flying toward an imposing Fire Nation fortress as the scene changes to its tower. The camera pans across the tri-level fortress and it's tall balconies before settling on a courtyard where a group of archers stand at the ready. Switch to a closer shot of a single archer. The archer draws his bow and releases three times in succession, sharply and accurately. Switch to a shot of the bowman's target. The first arrow strikes dead center, the second arrow splits the first arrow in half, and the third arrow splits the second arrow in half and completely impales the target. Switch back to a shot of the archers as they draw their bows. The camera pans up to a balcony where Colonel Shinu is arguing heatedly with Commander Zhao."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Shinu,"[In response to Zhao; somewhat angrily.] Absolutely not! The Yuyan Archers stay here. Your request is denied, Commander Zhao."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zhao,"Colonel Shinu, please reconsider ... Their precision is legendary. The Yuyan can pin a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away ... without killing it. [Annoyed.] You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Shinu,"I can do whatever I want with their talents, they're my archers, and what I say goes."

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Shinu,"[Cutting Zhao off mid-sentence while getting close to him and scoffing angrily.] Is nothing but a vanity project! We're fighting a real war here, and I need every man I've got, commander."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zhao,But-!
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Shinu,[Furiously.] That's final! I don't wanna hear another word about it!
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,"Zhao fumes. In the background, the cry of a messenger hawk is heard. Camera shifts to an above view and follows a messenger hawk as it reaches Colonel Shinu. Shinu opens the container on the hawk's back and reads the message inside with a puzzled expression."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zhao,[Intrigued.] News from Fire Lord Ozai?
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,"Shinu hands Zhao the message with irritation. Zhao takes the message, rudely brushing past the Colonel as he reads the news. Zhao smiles smugly."

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Katara,That's nice. I'll tell him.

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Katara,"Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,Sokka starts sniffing pitifully.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea. But I found a map. There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Katara,"Aang, he's in no condition for travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow. [Starts coughing.]"

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Katara,"Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fi- [She coughs again, this time with greater force, and lightly groans after.]"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,[Shielding his face.] That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender!

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,"A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too. I'm going to go find some medicine! [He grabs his glider and begins to head out just as a flash of lightning strikes.] Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. [To Appa and Momo.] Keep an eye on them guys. [Appa groans while Momo chitters.]"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Sokka,"Ha, ha! You guys are killing me!"

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Iroh,"Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,A soldier from the other ship walks in.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Soldier,[To Zuko.] The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance. All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Iroh,"Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him! [As Iroh makes a move in his Pai Sho game, another player slaps his hand against his own forehead as if he lost.]"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zuko,[Looking down.] I've got nothing to report to Admiral Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Soldier,Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zuko,Off my ship!
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Iroh,[Iroh wins his game.] Excellent! I take the pot! [A crew member punches himself.] But you're all improving! I'm certain you will win if we play again.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,The scene switches to a hidden outpost. One soldier is looking at Aang's wanted poster while the other is on watch duty.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Scout #1,[Reading Aang's wanted poster out loud.] Says here that the Avatar can create tornadoes and run faster than the wind. Pretty amazing!
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Scout #2,"Ah, that's just a bunch of Fire Lord propaganda! There's no way that's true!"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,The scout returns to his task and sees a cloud moving swiftly along the ground which turns out to be Aang. Aang runs by wrecking the outpost on accident. One of the scouts blows a horn signaling that Aang has been spotted.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Sokka,"[Weakly.] Katara, please, water."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Katara,"[Also weak.] Listen carefully, Momo. [Holds up a water skin.] I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water. [She is shown through Momo's eyes, speaking gibberish.] Got it? [Momo takes the skin and flies off.]"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,Aang runs up the stairs and enters the green house.

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Herbalist,"Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine. I've been up here for over forty years you know, used to be others, but they all left years ago. [She pets Miyuki who begins to purr.] Now it's just me and Miyuki."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,That's nice.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Herbalist,"Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys, and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,That's nice. Are you almost done?
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Herbalist,"Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient. [Walking among the shrubbery, looking around and muttering to herself.] Oh, sandalwood ... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf? Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,"Aang looks exasperated in the background and face-palms himself. Cut to Zuko's ship steaming by the shore, the sunset in its last stages in the background. Cut to Zuko practicing firebending on the foredeck in the background. Iroh's arm comes into the frame."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Iroh,Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zuko,I don't care what they do.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Iroh,Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zuko,"[Turning back, desperation and fear on his face.] How, Uncle? With Zhao's resources, it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar. [Turns back out to sea and whispers.] My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,"Cut back to an exterior shot of the herbalist institute, followed by a shot of the old woman in front of some bushes."

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,"[He lifts up his head off the table.] Finally! [Close-up of the mixing bowl as the herbalist drops the flower into the mixture, and Aang grabs for the bowl.] Thanks for all your help!"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,"The scene moves back, just as Aang wants to yank the bowl out of the herbalist's hands, and she slaps his hands roughly away with her spoon."

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,"[Rubs his hand, flinching.] Taking the cure to my friends."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Herbalist,[Lowers her spoon; laughs.] This isn't a cure! It's Miyuki's dinner. Plum blossom is her favorite.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,What about my friends?
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Herbalist,"Well, all they need are some frozen wood frogs. There's plenty down in the valley swamp."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,[Confused.] What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Herbalist,"Why, suck on them of course!"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,[Shocked and disgusted; his eye twitches.] Suck on them?

1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Herbalist,"[Crazily.] That's right! Well, don't stand there all day! Go!"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,Aang runs out and the storm gets worse; he wipes his face from the excessive rainfall. Several arrows comes out of nowhere and pins Aang's pants to the ground; he airbends a shield sending some off them away. Aang removes one.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,"Uh ... I think you dropped this ... [Screams as he sees the Yuyan Archers taking aim at him. Panicking, he frees himself from the arrow that had pinned his foot to the ground and runs. He falls off a cliff into a swamp and finds the frozen frogs.] A frog!"
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,Aang sticks the frog in his shirt and manages to get four more before getting one of his sleeves pinned to a rock. Aang waterbends an ice wall in front of himself. An arrow strikes the wall before two more land in the same spot and slice the arrows that came before it. The ice cracks and another set of arrows pin his other sleeve before a net is launched at him.
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zhao,"So this is the great Avatar. Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Aang,[Angry.] I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now!
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,Zhao,"Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left? Do you miss your people? [Aang looks down sadly.] Don't worry, you won't be killed like they were. [Aang looks angry again.] See, if you die you will just be reborn and the Fire Nation would have to start searching all over again. So I'll keep you alive, but just barely. [Aang takes a deep breath and blows at gale force at Zhao, who falls over.] Blow all the wind you want, but your situation is futile. There is no escaping this fortress, and no one is coming to rescue you."
1,13,The Blue Spirit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blue_Spirit,,Zhao exits the room with the door slamming behind him. Back to Katara and Sokka snuggled up in their sleeping bags which lie between Appa's feet. Sokka has a coughing fit.

The Blue Spirit runs from them and ducks into the shadows. Cut to a shot of an ornate balcony with bonfire pots on either side. The balcony is festooned with gold and red spades.

Suddenly they look up as a Fire Nation soldier's helmet comes bouncing down the corridor toward them. One of the guards walks up the corridor and turns right at the first junction, disappearing from view. A gout of flame erupts from the cross hallway as well as the sound of a brief scuffle. Two more guards go up to the junction and turn right, firebending stances at the ready. Cut to a view looking down the cross hallway. The first guard who went is hanging from the ceiling, tied up.

1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"[Delighted; with his mouth full.] Mm, not bad, not bad! [Holding out bowl to Aang.] Mhm?"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"[Refusing the bowl.] I'm good on puffs. [Sokka shrugs and continues eating the puffs; trying to act casual.] So, what do you think they're talking about back there?"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"[Causally, holding up puff.] Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"[Trying to act cool.] Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... [Tenses a bit and bites his fingers nervously.] Well, I've got to find a bathroom."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"He rises and walks away off-screen. Sokka lies down, relaxed and samples another puff. While eating it, Momo comes on-screen and sneakily takes the bowl away for himself. Sokka places his hand down to grab another curd puff, only to open his eyes and realize the bowl is gone. Cuts to Aang, who tiptoes down the hallway to where Aunt Wu had led Katara into another room, clearly ready to eavesdrop on their conversation. Cuts to shot of Aang pressing his ear to the doorway. The following conversation between Aunt Wu and Katara occurs off-screen from behind the wall."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,Your palms are so smooth. Do you use moisturizer?
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,"Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I can get you some if you want. [Aang sticks out his tongue; slight pause.] So, do you see anything interesting in my love line? [Aang immediately perks up upon hearing this.]"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,[Somewhat dramatically.] I feel a great romance for you. The man you are going to marry.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,[Excitedly.] Tell me more!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,I can see that he's a very powerful bender.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Upon hearing this statement, Aang smiles mischievously and leaps in the hallway, delighted upon hearing this. Cuts to the room where Sokka sits, picking his teeth. Aang struts into the room happily."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,Yeah ... when I was in there ...
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"[Disgusted, looking away and holding up a hand to signal Aang to stop.] I don't even want to know!"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,[Entering the room with Katara.] Who's next?
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"[Rising.] Okay, let's get this over with."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,"[Dryly.] Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,[Holding up his hands in protest.] But you didn't read my palms or anything!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,"I don't need to. It's written all over your face. [Sokka resumes picking his teeth in disgust; to Aang.] You there, come with me."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Aang follows Aunt Wu out of the room and into her chamber. The chamber is a fairly spacious, dimly lit room. Four pillars support the ceiling and four cushions are situated in the center of the room, surrounding a small fire. Off to the side is a jug of bones. Aunt Wu and Aang approach the jug."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,"This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie. [Urging Aang to pick a bone.] Go on, pick one. [Aang takes one bone and they sit down.] Now throw it on the fire. [Aang tosses the bone into the fire.] The heat makes cracks in the bone and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,Cuts to a shot of the bone sitting in the fire. The camera zooms in on the bone as a large crack splinters down its side.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"Wow, that's a big crack."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,[Surprised.] I've never seen this before!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Cuts to shot of the bone, camera panning to the right to show more cracks forming. The bone explodes and sends a burst of flames up to the ceiling."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,"[Her and Aang shielding their faces in surprise.] Oh my! [Cuts to shot of the bone lying in the fire and back to Aunt Wu who is fascinated.] Your destiny! This is incredible. You will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. A battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"[Casually.] Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,[Surprised.] A girl? You want to know about love?
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,[Excited.] Yes!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,"I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Aang looks down, disappointed at this. Aunt Wu realizes this."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,"[Trying to cheer him up.] Well, look! [Holding her hand against her face in mock forgetfulness.] I must've missed something. [Cuts to a bone piece lying on the floor; Wu picks it up.] Right here. [Holds bone up to examine it.] It says ""trust your heart and you will be with the one you love."""
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"Really? [Rises to his feet joyfully.] Thank you, Aunt Wu!"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"He runs out of the room gleefully. Aunt Wu hold her hand to her forehead and shakes her head in dismay. The scene changes to an overhead view of outside Wu's building, the three gathered together with Appa standing behind them. The three begin walking down a street."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,[Voice rising in anger.] That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"He roughly kicks a nearby stone, which soars into the air and comically ends up ricocheting off a hanging metal sign and striking the warrior, who had been standing breezily with his arms crossed. He covers his head in pain and falls to the ground, off-camera. Hunched over out of view, he raises a finger into the frame in protest, his tone agitated."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,That doesn't prove anything!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,"[Satisfied.] Well, I liked my predictions. [Clasps her hands together anxiously.] Certain things are going to turn out very well."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"[Slyly, crossing his arms and leaning in toward her.] They sure are ..."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,Why? What did she tell you?
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,[Ambiguously.] Some stuff. You'll find out.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Katara exits along with Aang, who folds his hands contentedly behind his head. Cuts to an overhead shot of the village courtyard, a pagoda-like structure lying centered in the middle. Cuts to shot of the villagers looking up at the sky before switching to a shot of the ground where the team approaches."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,[Looking at the sky.] What's with the sky?
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Calm man,[Also viewing the sky.] We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds to predict the fate of the whole village.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,[Pointing upward.] That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Calm man,[Slightly worried.] You better hope that's not a bunny! The fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,[Disgusted.] Do you even hear yourself?
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Village Woman,[Gesturing to the mountain in the background.] The cloud reading will tell us if Mt. Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Calm man,"We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain to check the volcano ourselves. [Smiles.] But every since Aunt Wu moved to the village twenty years ago, we have a tradition of not doing that."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,[Laying a hand on Sokka's shoulder.] Shhh! She's coming!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Cuts to shot from in between Katara and Sokka's heads. The camera zooms in to show Aunt Wu and her guard appearing on-screen, ascending a stairwell. Cuts to an overhead shot of the entire courtyard, the crowd having formed an aisle to allow for the two figures to pass by. Cuts to shot of Aang and Katara standing next to each other, smiling widely as Aunt Wu and the guard walk by them. The crowd is clapping for the fortuneteller. Meng appears on-screen next to Aang."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Meng,"[Trying to impress him.] Hey, Aang. [Pointing upward.] Don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"[Awkwardly.] Huh? Sure, I guess. [He pushes Meng away as the camera pans to the right; to Katara.] Hey, Katara, don't you think that cloud look like a flower?"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,[Annoyed.] Shhh!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Aang shows clear disappointment at being hushed. Cuts to the pagoda, where Aunt Wu approaches. She spreads her arms outward dramatically. Cuts to shot of the sky, an arrow-shaped cloud hovering above. Cuts to Aunt Wu who studies a cloud reading book in her hand."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,[Thoughtfully.] Bending arrow cloud ... good crops this year. Nice big harvest.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Farmer,[Hugs elderly woman happily.] Darn good news!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,"Wavy, moon-shaped cloud ... let's see. [Smiling.] Gonna be a great year for twins!"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Poi and Ping,[High-five each other joyfully.] Yes!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,[Thoughtfully.] And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it ... [Spreads arms outward again.] The village will not be destroyed by the volcano this year!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Cuts to an overhead shot of the courtyard, where the crowd cheers ecstatically. Cuts to shot of Aang and Katara standing among the crowds, their backs facing the camera."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,"[Slightly nervous.] Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Katara, enthralled with Aunt Wu and her predictions, runs off to follow the fortuneteller, clearly paying no attention to Aang. Aang becomes upset at this."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Aang,[Crushed.] Never mind.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"Cuts to shot of the upper levels of Aunt Wu's building, the camera panning downward to its entrance. Cuts to the hallway leading to Aunt Wu's chamber, where Katara stands before the doorway and knocks. Aunt Wu slides open the door."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,"Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Wu,Any time.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,"About this man I'm supposed to marry ... [Looks down awkwardly and blushes.] Is he going to be handsome? [Clasps her hands together hopefully.] Oh, I hope he's tall!"

1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,"Yes, please!"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"The two enter the room with the door sliding closed behind them. Cuts to shot of upper portion of Sokka's head, an angered expression on his face as he marches past in the courtyard."
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"I can't believe all these saps! [Cuts to side-view of Sokka walking forward, Aang following close behind.] Someone really needs to scream some sense into them."

1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. [Pulls over a man standing nearby.] Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she? [Cuts to shot of the man's red shoes.]"
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Man,Yeah. She said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Man,[Smiles sheepishly.] Everyday.
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,[Background becomes a spiral of swirling orange and yellow flames; angry.] Then of course it's gonna come true!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Man,[Delighted.] Really? You think so? [Begins walking away.] I'm so excited!
1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,,"In a fit of anger, Sokka kicks a nearby stone; it flies off-screen and ends up comically hitting a turkey duck, which flies on-screen and begins attacking Sokka.

1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,[Pleased.] Some stuff? [Places an arm around Aang's shoulders.] You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?

1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Sokka,"Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too."

1,14,The Fortuneteller,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Fortuneteller,Katara,Uh huh. Would you like some?

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,Really? That's great! [Raises his hands happily; Jeong Jeong groans in dismay fearing this may not end well.]

The screen pans up the river where Katara is practicing waterbending before switching to Aang and Jeong Jeong in front of the cottage. Aang stands, bandy legged, on a flat stone in the river. Jeong Jeong stands a foot or two away on the bank in front of his cottage."
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,"Widen your stance. Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. [Aang expresses his concentration.] Good, good!"

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,But what am I concentrating on?
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,"Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire. Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!"
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,So when do I get to make some fire?
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,Concentrate!
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,,"Aang breathes and is embarrassed as his friends laugh at him from behind. He turns to look at them, but they stop instantly, as he tries to innocent. Cut to a long shot of the figures in the distance climbing the slope of a mountain.

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,What?
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,You brought me up here to breathe?
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,Assume your stance.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,,Aang assumes the proper stance.

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,I've been breathing for hours!
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,You want to stop breathing?
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun! [Wiggles fingers to the ceiling to gesture this.] I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,"[Sighs gruffly.] I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline. He was only concerned with the power of fire - how he could use it to destroy his opponents and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible burden to bear. Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it. [While he was speaking, the camera cuts to Zhao on his boat; several men attack him, but he fends them off easily, leaving a fire in his wake. Cuts back to Jeong Jeong.]"

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,"Oh yeah! [Aang gets excited and airbends himself into the air. He quickly gets serious again.] I mean, let us begin."

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep the flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Tribal man,Master! There is trouble.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,What's going on?
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,Concentrate on your leaf!
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,[Annoyed.] This is the worst firebending instruction ever! All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe!
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Katara,I'm sure there's a good reason.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,But I'm ready to do so much more.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,,"Aang remembers to concentrate on his leaf and gets into a stance and breaths. Moments later, the leaf burns up creating a small flame."
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,[Excited.] I did it! I made fire!
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Katara,"Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow."
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,,Aang starts playing with it by tossing it back and forth from in front to behind himself. He makes a blast go in the opposite direction.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,Now that's some firebending!
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Katara,"Aang, you'll hurt yourself!"
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Aang,I wonder how that juggler did it.

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,I know! Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,,Katara runs off.

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,You have healing abilities. The great benders of the Water Tribe sometimes have this ability. I've always wished I were blessed like you - free from this burning curse.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Katara,But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know.
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,"Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart."
1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,,Suddenly the water is front of them is blasted with flames. Jeong Jeong gets up and gets into a defensive bending stance and breaks the flames that wash over him and Katara.

1,16,The Deserter,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Deserter,Jeong Jeong,Go get your friends and flee! Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!

The doors to the room open and reveal the personage of Aang in the Avatar State, who breathes fire and splits the floor in half. The real Aang falls through and lands on a Fire Navy ship in the Northern seas. The monstrous koi fish, called Koizilla, created when he and La had fused together during the Siege of the North appears before him, the personage of him inside. The Kozilla makes a downward cutting motion, and the personage does the same before a blinding white appears and the dream ends. Aang awakes from it and leaves the room where the gang is sleeping, exiting through a stairway. Katara awakens and catches sight of him leaving."

[The pattern of a labyrinth appears.] Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth. [The couple kisses.] But, one day, the man didn't come [Cuts to a shot of the woman alone, looking startled.] - he'd died in the war between the two villages. [Arrows fly by the screen. The woman is seen weeping by a grave.] Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ...

[Cuts to shot of the woman standing on a hill surrounded by the two villages.] Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. [Shows picture of the current-day Omashu.] The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. [The characters for ""Oma"" appear followed by the character for ""Shu"".

Aang jumps up onto Appa's saddle and creates an air shield around Appa, stabilizing the air and allowing Sokka to fall back into the saddle, uninjured. The wind sucks Appa, who is still protected by the air shield, into the tornado. Aang struggles to maintain the air shield, however as it shrinks, one of Appa's legs slips from the protective air, thereby breaking it.

2,5,Avatar Day,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Avatar_Day,Aang,[Unhappy.] I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.
2,5,Avatar Day,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Avatar_Day,Sokka,How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.
2,5,Avatar Day,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Avatar_Day,Aang,"[Cunningly.] That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective."

[Katara holds her hand to her brow, annoyed by Sokka's monologue.] See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. [Aang is making fun of Sokka, Katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs.] Okay, I guess I am pretty good."
2,5,Avatar Day,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Avatar_Day,Aang,"So, you'll help me with my case?"

An Earth Kingdom soldier sits in the front, holding the reins. Switch to the inside of the wagon, where a wealthy man in playing with his chest full of gold pieces. He is thrown to the front when the cart suddenly stops. The man looks around in fear, quickly closing and locking the chest with the precious metal. His scared eyes shift from side to side to as he hears rumbling noises outside. He clutches the chest protectively. The cold sweat is dripping down his face. He sighs in relieve as the noise died down, but he swiftly cowers back in fear as two swords pierce the top of the cart. A fist comes crashing down through the ceiling. When the aghast man looks up, he sees that it were the blades of the Blue Spirit that wrecked his cart. He anxiously holds up his treasury toward the Blue Spirit, while trying to stay away from him as far as possible. The Blue Spirit snatches it out of his hands and disappears, leaving the surprised man. The camera moves back to reveal the shocked man in his chart and the unconscious soldier on the ground."

[Sokka quickly squats beside the footprint to take a closer look at it.] It was at sunset, 370 years ago today, that she emerged from the temple, and struck down Chin the Great. After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader. [They all look up at a statue of Chin the Great, who has a raised left hand in triumph.] Feel free to appreciate it."

2,5,Avatar Day,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Avatar_Day,Sokka,"[Shoves Katara out of the way as she yelps.] If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime.

2,5,Avatar Day,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Avatar_Day,Aang,Then how can I prove my innocence?
2,5,Avatar Day,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Avatar_Day,Tong,"Simple. I say what happened [He points to himself, before pointing to Aang.], then you say what happened, and then I decide who's right.

She stomps the ground with the side of her left foot. A shock wave travels across the ground and causes a large rock to grow out of the ground underneath Aang, who is launched into the air. He lands softly on the ground behind her. She turns around with an upset expression on her face."

I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending. Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring. She must've took a dive and split the money with the kid."

2,6,The Blind Bandit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blind_Bandit,,They escort her and Aang peers at them from over a rooftop. He smiles and climbs down.

Servant brings a cup of soup to Toph. Lao notices."
2,6,The Blind Bandit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blind_Bandit,Lao,Blow on it. It's too hot for her.

2,6,The Blind Bandit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blind_Bandit,Aang,Then she must be a great earthbender! Probably good enough to teach someone else! [Toph sends a fissure under the table at him.] Ow!
2,6,The Blind Bandit,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Blind_Bandit,,Aang sits up a little. Lao casts an odd glance at his daughter who merely eats her soup.

[Aang lets down his defensive position and the two head out to the yard. Toph walks along the side of a bridge.] Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing. [Jumps down.] I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I feel the vibrations in the Earth, and I can see where everything is.

A little while later, Zuko smells food and spots a steak being cooked by a couple below the ridge he is walking on.

Zuko's eyes pop open as if he was only feigning sleep the whole time. Cut to a large sunflower garden, where Lee is practicing with the swords. He jumps around and chops off several sunflower heads.

Cut to Zuko's memory again; this time he is in the Royal Palace playing with his dagger from Iroh (the one he just gave to Lee.) He fakes his death, dramatically falling to the floor with a groan.

2,7,Zuko Alone,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Zuko_Alone,Young Zuko,[Confusedly.] Great-Grandfather won ... because ...
2,7,Zuko Alone,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Zuko_Alone,Young Azula,"Because even though his army was outnumbered, he cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes."

2,7,Zuko Alone,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Zuko_Alone,,"Azula stands up and moves forward. She begins with some circular motions, warms herself up, and firebends. Ozai smiles.

2,7,Zuko Alone,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Zuko_Alone,,"Ozai frowns at this news. Zuko starts off well, doing the same circular motions as Azula earlier.

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Cuts to shot of the forest, a cloud of smoke billowing toward them in a clearing in the distance. Appa appears on screen, the team riding atop him. Aang leans against the saddle to peer at the object."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,What is that thing?
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Cuts to a shot of a tank train mechanism racing speedily along the ground. Cuts to shot of the night sky, the moon partly obscured by clouds. Cuts to Aang who yawns sleepily, dark circles beginning to form under his eyes. Cuts to Sokka who appears ready to fall asleep as he leans his head on his hand. Cuts to Toph and Katara sitting on Appa's saddle idly. Cuts to Appa who flies over mountainous terrain and lands on a smooth, rocky surface."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,"[Leaping off Appa and lying on the ground, relieved.] Ah, land sweet land! [Rises and says cheerfully.] See you guys in the morning!"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"Actually, can you help us unload?"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,[Sarcastically.] Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Aang hands Sokka his sleeping bag which he proceeds to smell. Sokka turns away, his disgusted face growing red, and falls backward, passing out."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"[Curtly.] Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now, and -"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,[Points a finger at Katara in irritation.] Look! I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff! [Turns and begins walking away.] I'm carrying my own weight.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"[Angrily.] That's not the point. [Approaches Toph.] Ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful!"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,"[Enraged.] What? Look here, sugar queen, [Points finger at Katara.] I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending. So don't you talk to me about being selfish!"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"While she is saying this, a fuming Katara is seen tensing her muscles in frustration and raising her hand in an attempt to speak. After finished speaking, Toph sits down on the ground and earthbends an earth tent over her."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"[Furiously.] ""Sugar queen""?!Â [Toph uses earthbending to close the door of the tent.] D-did you just slam the door in my face?! How can you be so infuriating?!"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,Cuts to shot of Sokka and Aang standing several feet away. Katara angrily bangs her fists against the door of the wall and kicks the tent's walls with her feet.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,Should we do something?
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Amused.] Hey, I'm just enjoying the show."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,"[Approaching Katara.] Okay, okay, you both need to calm down."

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,[Awkwardly.] I ... can see that. [Backs off.]
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"The scene cuts to later at night, showing shot of the dark forest. Cuts to shot of Aang, Sokka and Katara lying on the ground. Aang is lying on the ground with Momo beside him while Sokka and Katara lie in sleeping bags."

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Toph uses earthbending to release a fissure that channels underground and sends Katara flying into the air. She lands on top of Sokka, startling him."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Annoyed; pushes Katara off to the side.] Hey, how's a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling [To Toph.] and earthquaking?"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,[Reopens her tent.] That thing is back!
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"Well, how far away is it? [Lies down and pulls covers of his sleeping bag over his head; says in a muffled voice.] Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes."

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"Seriously, what is that thing?"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,And how does it keep finding us?
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,"[Resting against the saddle; Sokka is seen lying on his back, sleeping.] I don't know. But this time, I'm going to make sure we lose it."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Cuts to a side-view of Appa flying past a mountain. Fades to scene of him flying between two mountain ridges. The bison lands on his side on a flat-surfaced rock bed, throwing everyone onto the ground along with their belongings."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Lands onto the ground.] Okay, forget about setting up camp. [Crawls along the ground in sleeping bag.] I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,[Angrily; pulling her sleeping bag under her head as a pillow.] That's good because Toph wasn't going to help anyway!
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,"[Irritated; lying on bag.] Oh, I didn't realize the baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,"Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what [Pulls top part of his shirt over his head; says in a muffled voice.] or who it is."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,It could be Zuko. [Rolls over on her side.] We haven't seem him since the North Pole.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,Who's Zuko?
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Puts his head down.] Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"[Mockingly.] What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail?"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,[Points to his top-knot.] This is a warrior's wolf tail.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"[Jokingly.] Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Raises head, unamused.] Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,Momo hops onto his sleeping bag and chitters excitedly.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Hold up finger to silence the lemur.] No Momo, shhh. [Relaxes.] Sleepy time."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Momo hops off Sokka and over to the ledge of the rock. He continues to chitter and raises his ears up in alert. Aang rises, followed by Toph and Katara."

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,I can feel it with my own two feet!
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,Aang runs to the edge of the cliff next to Momo and notices smoke rising from the far end of the rocky pathway. Cuts to a shot of the tank train as it rumbles up a slope and onto level ground.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,[Nervously.] Let's get out of here.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,"[Calmly.] Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly."

The camera pans downward to where the three girls stand atop the Lizards. Cuts to shot of Azula, a determined look on her face. The three begin racing toward the group."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,[Alarmed.] It's those three girls from Omashu!
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,Everyone assumes fighting stances.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,[Determined.] We can take them. Three on three.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"Actually Toph, there's four of us."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,"[Sheepishly.] Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Turning to her, his face distorted with rage.] I can still fight!"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,"[Smugly.] Okay, three on three plus Sokka."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,[Face turns red.] Errrgh!
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Toph earthbends three columns in an attempt to hinder the girls, however, the Mongoose Lizards merely leap over the pillars and continues on their way."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"Well, we wanted to find out who they were and we found out. [Puts boomerang away; Aang and Katara are seen fleeing.] Now let's get out of here."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"Toph earthbends a huge rock wall in front of the trio. Cuts to Azula who moves her arms in a circular motion, generating lightning. She fires the bolt at the wall, blowing a huge hole in it. Shows the lizards as they clamber through the hole. Toph is clearly shocked at this. Cuts to Mai who swings her arm, releasing a flurry of stilettos. Toph launches herself off a pillar. The darts strike the pillar and she lands on Appa."

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"They manage to escape successfully, narrowly avoiding a blue fire blast. Cuts to shot of Azula who lowers her arm and looks up at the retreating group. Cuts to a sleepy Appa."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,[Shocked.] I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,[Grumpily.] I still think we could have taken them.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"Are you kidding me? [Points fingers upward repeatedly in gesture.] The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,,"The scene cuts to a shot of the landscape, a prairie below, mountains in the distance. The sun is seen rising over the horizon as Appa soars past."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Complaining.] Oh no, the sun is rising. We've been up all night with no sleep!"

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,[Nervously.] Are you sure? I've never not slept before! [Holds hands up to his head.] What if I fall asleep now and something happens? [Freaks out; eyes bulge out.] And something always happens!
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"Every time we land, those girls are there. So we'll just have to keep flying."

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,[Yawns.] So what's our plan?

Appa soars through the trees, colliding into and snapping several branches. Cuts to shot of the team members who brace against the impact. The camera zooms out to depict a flock of birds resting in the trees, fleeing from the incident, before panning downward to show Appa on the ground, having created a channel way behind him from the impact. Cuts to shot of Appa sleeping once more; Aang slides off his head and onto the ground."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,Appa's exhausted.
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Sokka,"[Trudging across the ground, carrying his sleeping bag.] Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep."

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,"[Trying to calm the tension.] All right, all right, everyone's exhausted! Let's just get some rest."
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Toph,"[Rises and faces Katara.] No, I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have issues?"
2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Katara,"[Irritated.] I'm just saying. Maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep [Shouting.] and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!"

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,[Grabs a handful of fur and watches as it blows away in the wind.] I have a plan.

He scrubs the bison's head and is forced to hastily take flight when a stream of water is bent his way. Cuts to shot of Appa's head, Sokka standing in the river several feet away, holding a brush. He groans as he becomes drenched by the stream of water. The scene changes to the campsite where Appa stands on the ground, his fur still wet from the bath.

2,8,The Chase,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Chase,Aang,He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here. [Kneels down and places pieces of Appa's fur into his satchel.] I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course.

2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,Back at Iroh and Zuko's setup.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,"I see. That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. [Outside.] There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning. [Steps up, and generates lightning, and shoots it away from the two.]"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,I'm ready to try it!
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,"Zuko takes a deep breath. He tries to generate lightning, but instead an explosion launches him back. Iroh shakes his head in disappointment. "
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. Like this! [Stretches out, still in stance.]"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,"Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"I'm glad you said something. Actually there is a better way. [Blindfolds Aang.] This way, you'll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"[Sarcastically.] Yeah, thanks, Katara!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,[Nervously.] Heh.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,"Cut to Toph standing at the top of the hill with Aang at the bottom. She shoves the rock forward and it begins to roll down the slope. Aang looks worried and afraid as it rolls toward him. He jumps over the boulder at the last second, causing it to roll past and crash into the cliff. Toph comes running toward Aang."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,[Disappointed.] I know. I'm sorry.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"Yeah, you are sorry! If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"No, I don't think I do."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,"Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"Yeah, that sounds good."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,They all exit.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,Back to Zuko and Iroh. Another attempt by Zuko to generate lightning fails.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,What turmoil?
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,But I don't feel any shame at all. I'm as proud as ever.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,"Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself. [Zuko smiles.]"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,"Back to Sokka, who remains trapped with the small, brown animal."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. [The cub brings an apple.] Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it. [Tosses his boomerang at it in a desperate attempt.] Now, come back boomerang."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,In a pond in another part of the canyon. Momo tries to grab a frog. Aang and Katara move a single blob of water back and forth among each other in a circular motion.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,"You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,I don't want to talk about it.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,"You do realize that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding itâ"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"[Frustrated at himself.] I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,"Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,I guess it's earth.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,"That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast! [Throws a piece of reed at him, but Aang slices it in half with waterbending.] Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara. [Bows.]"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,Katara also bows at Aang. Back to Zuko and Iroh.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Fire is the element of power. [Draws the firebending insignia in the dirt.] The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. [Draws the earthbending insignia.] The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. [Draws the airbending insignia.] The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! [Smiles broadly but returns to a more serious demeanor when Zuko doesn't react at all.] Water is the element of change. [Draws the waterbending insignia.] The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,Why are you telling me these things?
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. [Divides the four insignias into separate sections.] Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole. [Draws a circle around the insignias.]"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,"Back to the campsite. Aang is meditating when Toph enters, holding Aang's staff."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"You know, I'm really glad you feel that way. Because I also have this great new nutcracker."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,"She spins Aang's staff above her head. Cut to Aang, who looks over his shoulder with a pained expression on his face. Cut to Toph as she smiles widely, lifts the staff, and starts using it to break nutshells."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... [Crack.] That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ... [Crack.] It's a delicate instrument!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Toph,"It's not the only delicate instrument around here. [Walks away, hitting the staff off rocks.]"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,[Resumes meditating.] Ohm.

2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,[Frustrated.] Meditating here!
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Katara,It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,We'll find him faster if we split up. [The two begin to search.]
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,Back to Sokka.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? [Sokka's warrior's wolf tail gets yanked out of his hair by the cub.] Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal? [Aang shows up.] Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,Sokka! Are you okay? [Tries to pull him out.]
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here. [Blows up a gust of wind but Sokka remains trapped.]
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,I can't ... I can't do it.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,I can't do that either.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,You can't? Why not?
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,It would just be really ... uncomfortable.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"Uncomfortable? [Sarcastically.] Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ..."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"Awkward position, I think I know the feeling."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,"Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,"Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Sokka,Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Aang,It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama?
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,"Suddenly, a large moose-lion appears."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,The scene cuts back to Zuko and Iroh.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning."
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,You can teach me to redirect lightning?
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean. [Laughs.] From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this. [The two begin to practice the redirection motion.] Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,I think so.
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Come on, you've got to feel the flow. [They practice the motion for a few minutes.] Excellent! You've got it!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,"Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,I thought that was the point! You teaching me to protect myself from it!
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Iroh,"Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,Zuko,"Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning. [Rides away.]"
2,9,Bitter Work,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Bitter_Work,,"Back to the canyon, Aang begins to talk to the saber-tooth moose-lion mother."

2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,The episode begins with a view of the mountains. The camera pans down to show a back shot of Aang sitting in cross legged in a prairie on the ground looking over a vast open savanna landscape. The landscape is mostly barren save for small shoots of grass which bend in the breeze. A range of mountains can be seen in the distance. The ground in front of Aang is littered with holes.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,What's out here?

Momo jumps into a hole and comes out the middle one, trying to catch the groundhogs. The shot shows all of the holes in the ground. Aang plays four notes and Momo tries to catch the groundhogs that pop up. Aang plays another note as Sokka runs up to Aang and plugs the flute with his finger, causing nothing to play. As Aang's cheeks swell with air, the Avatar looks at Sokka with a sad expression."

2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off!
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,"[Walks next to Aang.] Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,"Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation. [Gestures to the side, sarcastically.] Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? [Knocking on an imaginary door.] Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,Aang plays a note on the flute and a groundhog pops up underneath Sokka and sings the note.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,"All right, we'll finish our vacations and [Mockingly.] then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence. [Aang laughs.]"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,"[Opening a map and shows it to Katara.] Your turn, Katara. Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,[Pointing at the map.] How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,"Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't use the word ""pristine"". [Cut to the symbol on the map.] It's one of nature's wonders."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,"The close-up of the map's illustration fades to the Misty Palm Oasis, which has a small ice spring in the center. Cut to a shot of Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph stare at the oasis in disappointment."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,Must've changed ownership since I was here. [Laughs sheepishly.]
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,"They walk through the entrance and the hanging sign falls down. Fade to Team Avatar walking past the small ice spring. They walk into the bar and pass five sandbenders hanging around outside. One sandbender spits at Sokka's feet. Sokka looks at the man angrily. The man utters a raspy groan, slurps, and chuckles. Katara grabs Sokka and pulls him into the bar, which is filled with weary travelers."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"[To the bartender.] One mango, please."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,"The bartender uses two swords to slice a bowl from a large chunk of ice. He cuts down some mangos from the overhanging fruit and dices them up. He chops up a piece of fruit and pours a jug of milk into the bowl, still using the swords. He throws a decorative umbrella and straw into the bowl and serves it to Zei, who gives the bartender a coin."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy. [Runs up to the bartender.] Excuse me.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,Zei bumps into Aang and spills his drink onto the airbender.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,"No worries, I clean up easy. [Airbends the drink off of his clothes.]"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,[Gasps.] You're a living relic.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,"[Shrugs.] Thanks, I try."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"An Air Nomad, right in front of me. [Shot changes to show Katara holding an icy bowl.] Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University. [Grabs Aang's arm and points at his arrow tattoo. Camera pans to Aang's face.] Tell me, which of the air temples do you hail from?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,The Southern Temple.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"[Measures Aang's head with a pair of calipers and speaking excitedly.] Oh, splendid! Now tell me- what was the primary agricultural product of your people?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,"[Nervously.] Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal. [While Sokka speaks, Zei writes in his journal.]"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,"So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,Certainly.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,Sokka unrolls a map on a table and examines. Toph sips her drink and props her legs on another chair.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,"What, no Fire Nation? [Straightening his back.] Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,[Examines the map while the camera pans across it.] You've made a lot of trips into the desert.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"All in vain, I'm afraid. I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom, [Raises his fist slightly.] but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel: Wan Shi Tong's Library. [Cut to a shot of Toph laying down. Her feet are closest to the camera, showing her dirt-stained soles.]"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Toph,[In disbelief.] You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"This library is more valuable than gold, little lady. It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge is priceless."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Toph,"[Sarcastically.] Hmm, sounds like good times."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great Knowledge Spirit, Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his ""foxy"" knowledge seekers."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,"[Intrigued.] Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,"[Puts her hand on the side of Sokka's face to stop him from talking.] I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"You're both right. [Katara and Sokka turn to him in surprise. Cut to Zei.] Handsome little creatures. [Takes out a drawing of the library and places it on the table.] Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to read, so that we might better ourselves."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,"If this place has books from all over the world, [Aang walks over to look at the maps while he sips his drink.] do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map, maybe?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"I wouldn't know. But if such a thing exists, it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,"Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation [Cut to a shot of Sokka as he points his finger into the air dramatically. The background changes to a rushing one.] at the library! [Sokka's voice echoes. Zoom back to a group shot, with Sokka still having his finger raised in the air.]"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Toph,"[Waving her hand to gain the others attention.] Uh, hey, what about me? When do I get to pick?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Toph,Hmph! [Slams her drink on the table and folds her arms. Cut to a shot of Zei.]
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"Of course, there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert and almost died each time. [In a depressed voice.] I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,"Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,A sky bison?! You actually have one?
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,"Cut to Appa retreating from four sandbenders, as he growls."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,"[Runs toward the sandbenders.] Sandbenders, shoo, away from the bison!"
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,"The sandbenders run away and get into two sand-sailers. They drive the sailers by creating a small tornado of sand near the sail. Cut to a ground view of Appa flying across the sky. Cut to Appa's saddle and pan from Katara and Toph leaning against the sides to Sokka who grabs a telescope and looks over the side. The shot changes to Momo, Zei, and Aang on Appa's head.

I only wish I spoke his tongue. [Scratches Appa's head.] Oh, the stories this beast could tell. [Momo crawls up to Zei's side and starts chittering.] Shush, chatty monkey."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Aang,"[Examines the picture of the library.] Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,Appa flies away from the camera. Cut back to the saddle.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Toph,[Groans in frustration.] Does this place even exist?
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Zei,Some say it doesn't.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Toph,"[Eyes widen in surprise before narrowing.] Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? [Collapses on the saddle, putting her feet over the side.]"

[Everybody on Appa looks to where Toph is pointing, but they can only see sand dunes. Aang, Katara, and Sokka glare at Toph in annoyance for tricking them. Cut back to the shot of Toph.] That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it. [Waves her hand in front of her face with a blank grin to remind them of the fact that she is blind. She quickly goes back to clutching the saddle.]"

2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,[Holding the illustrations.] Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. [Side shot.] The building in this drawing is enormous.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,,They see a sparkle in the distance and a fox holding a scroll with its mouth walking over a dune.

2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Sokka,That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Toph,I say you guys go ahead without me.
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,You got something against libraries?

[Pushes Aang back.] Sorry."
2,10,The Library,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Library,Katara,"That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge."

Several sections of the drill extend forward, releasing steam as spikes are driven into the ground. The drill's command module ascends where inside are Princess Azula, her friends, Mai and Ty Lee, War Minister Qin and several operators of the drill."
2,13,The Drill,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Drill,Qin,"This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth Kingdom will finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father. Nothing can stop us."

2,13,The Drill,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Drill,General Sung,"[Slightly taken aback.] Well ... uh, technically yes, but he was quickly expunged.

2,13,The Drill,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Drill,Aang,"[Struck with realization.] Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike. [Rises.] Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance. [Strikes Sokka several times.] And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow. [Hits him softly on the head.] His own weight becomes his downfall, literally."

2,13,The Drill,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Drill,Katara,"So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through."

Katara uses waterbending to stop the flow of slurry and plug up the back entrance of the drill, thus trapping Ty Lee."

2,13,The Drill,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Drill,,The soldiers nod and launch another round of rocks toward the drill.

Azula shoots fire blasts at Aang, who manages to block them using airbending. She continues the fire attacks only to have each one of her strikes deterred by water whips. She eventually manages to vaporize the water, sending Aang back. The two narrowly dodge the several boulders that are hurtled toward them at that moment. Aang uses earthbending and airbending to send rocks at Azula, who manages to avoid them all. Azula sends another powerful firebending assault that slams Aang into the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se, leaving him unconscious."
2,13,The Drill,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Drill,Aang,"Thanks, Momo. I owe you one. [Runs over to the wedge he sliced in the drill.] Now all I need ... [A boulder falls before him.] Actually, that is what I need for once."

Using earthbending, he cuts the rock several times, creating a wedge that fits inside the middle of the hole. He begins sprinting toward the wall, scales up its side by riding an air scooter and, once he arrives at his highest point, rockets at lightning speed toward the bottom. As he propels himself downward, Azula catches sight of him and fires at him. She misses by mere seconds and is sent back forcefully as Aang leaps and slams down on the wedge, creating a large ripple effect. The impact of the blow causes the sliced braces inside the drill to collapse and the pipes to burst, releasing a torrent of slurry. Slurry begins to seep from the drill. The scene cuts to Katara and Toph, who remain in their bending stances."

Aang stops blowing the whistle, jumps off his air scooter, on onto his glider, as the animals go out through the gate. The creatures go through the opening as he soars up and over the wall. On the other side, the creatures are shown coming out of the opening and starting to spread out in all directions as they run. Shot cuts to show Aang soaring down behind the running animals and hopping onto his air scooter again. As he rides, he punches the ground causing a large wall of earth to rise as he rides in a large circle creating a pen to block the running animals. Once he finishes, he jumps off his scooter and lands in the center of the pen he made. He earthbends again, causing a square portion of the ground to descend and creates a small pit. He turns around and brings his arms up high to cause some large pillars of earth to rise, making plateaus, turns, and punches outward which makes more walls to separate the animals."

2,17,Lake Laogai,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Lake_Laogai_(episode),Aang,Why are you here?

2,17,Lake Laogai,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Lake_Laogai_(episode),Long Feng,No. It's much too dangerous for us to confront him directly. Let's see if we can still handle this quietly.

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- [A giant rock almost hits them.] Aahh!"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,What was that?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,Surface-to-air rocks! [Sees more being launched.] More incoming!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"They dodge a few more rocks. One gets launched right at Aang, but he destroys it with his hand. Another is launched at them head on, but Aang slices it cleanly in two by swinging his staff at the rock to augment his earthbending. He launches himself from Appa to the front of the palace and slams his staff into the ground, generating a massive earthen wave to knock back the palace guards. Appa lands and roars at the captain's ostrich horse, which causes it to drop the captain and run off. As they continue toward the Earth King, more guards appear and launch earth cubes at the gang. Toph and Aang use earthbending to block the attacks, while Katara uses waterbending to subdue the guards."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,[Water whips two guards.] Sorry!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Katara turns around and strikes down more guards with her waterbending, though closes her right eye in a sympathetic flinch for a moment as she does so. As more guards rush toward them in an attempt to halt Team Avatar's progress, Toph uses her earthbending to flip the tiles of the walkway, trapping them between them and ensuring a clear passage for the team."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"More guards appear on the opposite end of a bridge and launch two giant statues at them. Toph and Aang create an earth igloo to block the statues. Katara creates an ice ramp to jump to the other side of the bridge and water-whips the guards into the water. Aang freezes them in the water as the rest all jump across. More surface-to-air rocks appear as guards are coming down a giant staircase. Toph uses earthbending to change the stairs into a ramp, causing them all to fall. She and Aang use earthbending to escalate themselves up the stairs."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side! [Pauses for a moment.] Sorry."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,More guards come and Aang and Toph push them away with earthbending.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,In there! [They enter the palace.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,They come to an area with three doors. More guards appear and Toph easily defeats them all.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Toph, which way to the Earth King?"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,How should I know? I'm still voting we leave Ba Sing Se.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Toph defeats more guards while Sokka opens the doors to find the Earth King. The first room is empty, as is the second; outside the second door, a royal guard goes flying to the right off-screen. Sokka bursts into a third room, startling a woman."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Palace woman,"Burglar! [Tries to run, trips, and falls flat on her face.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,[Shuts the door.] Sorry. Wrong door.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Meanwhile, Zuko and Iroh return from Lake Laogai. The former seems ill."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Iroh,You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Zuko,I don't feel right. [Gets dizzy and passes out.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Iroh,Zuko! [Rushes to him.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Back at the palace, the team arrives at a pile of rubble. Sokka climbs atop it and sees a gigantic door."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. [Drops down from the rubble and attempts to kick the door open.] Yaaah! [The door does not move even slightly. Sokka starts trying to push it open, but to no avail. Toph and Aang jump in from behind and bust the door down, knocking Sokka forward in the process. He starts rubbing the back of his head.] A little warning next time?"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,They arrive in the Earth King's chamber with Kuei sitting in his throne. Long Feng and his Dai Li agents stand in their way. The team takes fighting stances against them.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,We need to talk to you.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,[Turns to face the Earth King.] They're here to overthrow you.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"No, we're on your side. We're here to help."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,You have to trust us.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"[Stands up with a rising aggravated tone.] You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to trust you?"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,He has a good point.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"If you are on my side, then drop your weapons and stand down!"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"They look at each other for a moment. Aang drops his staff, Katara puts her water whip back in her water skin, Sokka drops his machete, and Toph drops the boulder she is levitating."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"[Smiles.] See? We're friends, Your Earthiness. [Gives a slight nervous chuckle.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,The king says nothing and just continues to frown grimly. Long Feng signals the Dai Li to cuff their arms with rock gloves.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,[Smiles sinisterly.] Detain the assailants!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,The Dai Li rush behind Team Avatar.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again. [The king looks at him shocked.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,The Avatar? [Points at Sokka.] You're the Avatar?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Uh, no. Him. [Nudges his head at Aang.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,[Effortlessly breaks free of his earth cuffs and raises his arms.] Over here. [Re-attaches the cuffs.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,"What does it matter, Your Highness? They're enemies of the state."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"Perhaps you're right. [Sees Bosco sniff and lick Aang, who laughs, and smiles at Long Feng.] Though Bosco seems to like him. [Looks back at the team.] I'll hear what he has to say. [Long Feng glares at Aang.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"[Walks forward.] Well, sir, there's a war going on right now. For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,A secret war? That's crazy!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,Completely!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes; he brainwashed our friend!"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,"[Quickly turns to face the king.] All lies. I've never even seen a sky bison, Your Majesty. Frankly, I thought they were extinct."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,[Sits down.] Your claim is difficult to believe. Even from an Avatar.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,"[Whispers in his ear.] These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks. [Kuei looks shocked at what Long Feng is telling him.]Â If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,[Thinks for a moment.] I have to trust my advisor.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"The agents start taking the team away, but Sokka stops for a moment."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,Wait! [Turns to face the king with a big smile.] I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his robe.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,What? I am not disrobing! [The king looks thoughtful before looking at Sokka suspiciously.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Aang and Sokka smile slyly and nod at each other. Aang blows a large gust of air at Long Feng's legs, lifting his robe and revealing a bite mark left by Appa."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,Right there! Appa bit him!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Never met a sky bison, huh?"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Long Feng,[Lowers his robe.] That happens to be a large birth mark. [Sarcastically.] Thanks for showing everyone.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,Well I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,Of course there is!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,The group gets Appa and brings him in. He opens his mouth. Aang points at the bison's teeth and at Long Feng's mark.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"Yup. That pretty much proves it. [Team Avatar cheers.] But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory. [Team Avatar becomes downcast.] Though, I suppose this matter's worth looking into. [Team Avatar look at each other approvingly, while Long Feng glares at the king before walking away with his agents.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Back in Iroh and Zuko's apartment, Zuko is asleep. He wakes up."

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Zuko,"So thirsty. [Sits up, but Iroh makes him lie back down.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Iroh,[Grabs a bucket with a spoon in it; takes out the spoon.] Here's some clean water to drink. [Sits him up slightly.] Stay under the blankets and sweat this out.

He drinks from it, while spilling some out. He tosses the bucket aside and lies back down. Iroh pulls the covers more over him. Meanwhile, on a train, passengers are shocked to see the Earth King, who is standing in the middle of the cart surrounded by guards."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,[Feeling strange from exposition.] So this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this ... public.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"I've never been outside the palace. [Katara and Sokka look at each other; the Earth King looks outside and sees Aang flying on Appa.] Now that's the way to travel. [Looks at Katara and Sokka.] So, may I ask where we're going?"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place."

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,Oh don't tell me-Â ! [Gives a thumbs up and a fake smile.] That's okay. Still got my positive attitude.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,[Looks suspicious.] Hm ... [Sarcastically.] That seems awfully convenient.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more. [Smiles and nods.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"Long Feng was right. This was a waste of time. [Turns to leave.] If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,[Smiles with realization.] The wall. They'll never be able to cover that up in time.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"Oh, yeah. [Hops to in front of the king.] If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,No Earth King has ever been to the Outer Wall. [Walks past Aang.] I don't have any more time for this nonsense. [Aang looks depressed.]

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,It's both thrilling and terrifying!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,"Yeah. [Smiles.] I hate it, too."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,I have to be honest with you: part of me really hopes that what you're telling me about this war isn't true.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,I wish it wasn't.

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,It's a drill. A giant drill [Cut to the drill.] made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls. [Cut to a close-up of the king who looks horrified.]

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,[Momo climbs up Kuei's arm.] We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. [Cut to a close-up of the king. Cut back to Sokka.] The Day of Black Sun.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se. We'd be completely vulnerable.

2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,[Opens the scroll and reads it.] It's a letter from your mom. Your mom's here in the city. And she wants to see you. [Toph's eyes widen with shock.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? [Shakes her head.] That's just sad.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,[Takes out another scroll and hands it to Aang.] Aang?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,General How,This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,[Opens the scroll and reads it.] It's from the Eastern Air Temple.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,[Looks in the box.] I'm afraid not.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,[He and Katara become downcast.] Oh.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,General How,But there is an intelligence report that might interest you. [Hands a scroll to Katara.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"[Opens the scroll and reads it.] ""A small fleet of Water Tribe ships."""
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,[Shocked. Appears on Katara's side.] What? That could be Dad!
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"[Reads the report with excitement.] ""Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay. [Her and Sokka's eyes widen.] Led by Hakoda."" [Katara and Sokka turn to each other in excitement.] It is Dad!"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Meanwhile at the apartment, Iroh is pouring tea."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Iroh,"You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea. [Feeds Zuko the tea.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Zuko,What's happening?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Iroh,Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body. [Feeds Zuko more tea.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Zuko,What's that mean? [Coughs continuously and lies down.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Iroh,"You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, [Takes a cloth and wipes Zuko's head.] you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,Back in Long Feng's office.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a guru.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,What's a guru? Some kind of poisonous blow fish?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,And I can't believe we know where our dad is now.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,I know what you mean. My mom's in the city. And from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,This is all such big news! Where do we even start?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"I hate to say it, but we have to split up."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,[Worriedly.] Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together! Now you want us to separate?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"You have to meet this guru, Aang. If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. [Stands up.] I guess that's me.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"No, Sokka. I know how badly you wanna help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay. I'll stay here with the king."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,[Overjoyed with tears welling in his eyes. Stands up and dances happily.] You are the nicest ... sister ... ever! [Throws his arms around Katara and kisses her on the cheek.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"Easy there, big brother ... [Gives a slight chuckle.] Though you're right. I am."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Outside the Palace, Team Avatar is preparing to leave. The king walks down to them. Katara is petting Appa. Aang turns to face her."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,Katara? I need to tell you something. [Starts blushing.] I've been wanting to say it for a long time.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"What is it, Aang?"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"[Rubs the back of his head.] Katara, I- [He is cut off by Sokka.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"[Throws Aang in a headlock.] All right. Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip? [Noogies Aang. Katara looks at him, annoyed.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"Aang and Sokka, [They look at him.] I wish you a good journey. Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks. We look forward to your safe return. [Aang, Katara, and Sokka bow.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,Sokka starts climbing atop Appa. A soldier walks up to the king.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Soldier,Your Majesty. There are three female warriors to see you. They're from the island of Kyoshi.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,[Shocked.] That's Suki! [Falls off Appa.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,You know these warriors?
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,[Gets up.] Oh yeah. The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters. Trustworthy too. They're good friends of ours.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,Then we shall welcome them as honored guests.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"[Aang turns to Appa.] Wait. Aang. [She hugs him, which startles him, then kisses him on the cheek, causing him to blush.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,I'm really gonna miss you guys.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Katara,"[Hugs Toph with Aang. Sokka looks away, crossing his arms.] Me too."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,Yeah.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"[Everyone goes to hug him.] Aahh! Great. That's enough. [Smiles.] Okay, we love each other. [Pats Aang and Katara on the head.] Seriously."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Appa flies off. Back at the apartment, Iroh and Zuko are asleep. Zuko wakes up and walks into the bathroom. He washes his face with water. When he looks in the mirror, he sees himself with no scar, no hair and an arrow tattoo on his head, resembling Aang. He looks horrified. He screams himself awake and breathes heavily. He touches the scar on his face and closes his eyes. Meanwhile, Appa is flying Sokka and Aang. Sokka is resting across Appa's back."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,"You see, Aang? A little positive thinking works wonders. We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Aang,"[Dreamily.] Yeah. Girls are waiting for us. Thanks, positive attitude."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Sokka,Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever. [Aang turns around and smiles at him.]
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"In a prison, Long Feng is sitting in his cell. A Dai Li agent appears outside of the cell."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Agent,"[Slides a tray of food underneath the door.] Dinner. [Long Feng grabs some food.] The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King, [Long Feng looks at him.] but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir. [Walks away as Long Feng eats his food while smiling sinisterly.]"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Meanwhile, at a random house, Toph is outside. She exhales deeply and knocks on the door. It opens on its own."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Toph,"[Enters.] Hello? Mom? Anyone home? [Walks to the center of the room. She senses something, but is quickly captured in a metal box. In a scared voice.] Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with!?"
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,Xin Fu and Master Yu appear.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Xin Fu,One loud-mouthed little brat who strayed too far from home.
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,,"Back at the palace, three Kyoshi Warriors are walking up to the king and bow."
2,18,The Earth King,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Earth_King,Kuei,"In our hour of need, it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies, the Kyoshi Warriors!"

2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,The episode starts with a view of the exterior of Zuko and Iroh's apartment. Cut to the interior. Iroh is preparing food when Zuko awakens.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Zuko,What's that smell?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Iroh,It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Zuko,"[Sniffs.] Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, Uncle. [Holds a bowl up.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Iroh,"Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Zuko,"[Optimistically.] It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. [Moves to a table and sits.] Things are looking up, Uncle. [Starts drinking the jook.Â Iroh's shocked expression changes to a smile.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang and Sokka fly on Appa to a Water Tribe camp, where Hakoda is."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,You haven't seen your dad in over two years. You must be so excited!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,"[Almost throwing up.] I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach. [Holds his stomach.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,Don't be nervous. He's going to be so happy to see you! [He puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder who smiles.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this guru?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes. [Sokka gets off Appa.] See you in a week. Yip yip!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang and Appa fly away. Sokka arrives at the camp, where all the warriors greet him warmly."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Water Tribe warrior,"Sokka, good to see you."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"He looks and sees the main tent. Inside, Hakoda, Sokka's father, is looking at a map with more warriors, including Bato, now with scars on his arm. Bato nudges Hakoda and Hakoda becomes happy upon seeing Sokka."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,Sokka.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,"Hi, Dad."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"The two embrace. Back at the Earth King's Royal Palace, the ""Kyoshi Warriors"", Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee in disguise, sit before King Kuei."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Kuei,"Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited? [Bosco yawns.] It's been a difficult week for me. My most trusted advisor, Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se from me."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Kuei,"[Pets Bosco.] But there is good news. As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation this summer, on the day of a solar eclipse."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"For a second, Azula's eyes slightly widen with shock and worry upon hearing this, but she quickly hides it."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan. [Glances off as Mai and Ty Lee look at each other.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Cut to the Council of Five meeting, where Katara and Momo are present."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,General How,"General Fong's base will serve as the launching point for the attack. In exactly two months, the army and navy will invade the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,Momo jumps on the map and begins knocking over the pieces.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Katara,"Or we could send in Momo to do some damage! [Chuckles. The Council of Five are unamused.] 'Cause, the ... sorry."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,General How,"[Uses earthbending to stand the pieces back up, scaring Momo.] All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan. [Sends the scroll across the table to Katara.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Katara,"I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang continues his journey to the Eastern Air Temple. He spots Guru Pathik, who is meditating, and lands Appa."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right? [Aang approaches Pathik.] The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso. [Aang looks slightly surprised to hear this.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"In your note, [Aang sits.] you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world. And the first step to gaining balance begins with this. [Hands Aang a yellow beverage in a wooden cup.] Drink up!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,[Takes it and looks at it. Drinks it and quickly spits it out to his left in disgust.] Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,That's because it is! [Pathik empties another bowl and holds it over his head.] Yum yum!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang blinks in disbelief. Meanwhile, Xin Fu and Master Yu are working to bring Toph back to the Beifong Estate."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Yu,I believe we need to go right!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Xin Fu,What are you talking about? The Beifong Estate's this way!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Yu,I'm quite certain you're mistaken.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Toph,[Banging at the cell.] Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second? [Cut to inside the cell.] I got to go to the bathroom!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Yu,"Oooh ... uhhh, okay, but make it quick! [Getting up with a key in hand.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Xin Fu,[Stopping Yu.] What's wrong with you?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Yu,"Ooh, very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me! [Sits down.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Toph,Let me out of here so I can kick both your butts!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Xin Fu,"Quit your banging! [Bangs the metal box.] You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Toph looks sad as she places her hand on a side of the metal box. The scene cuts to that night, and where Azula, Mai and Ty Lee are staying which is a small building in the Upper Ring. Mai and Ty Lee are removing their make-up. A smiling Ty Lee is looking in a mirror. She is wiping the last traces of her Kyoshi makeup from her face. Mai is seated next to Ty Lee, still working on her own face."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,"We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Ty Lee,Mai finally gets to wear make-up that's not totally depressing? [Azula walks past toward a window.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Mai,"[With large, dark splotches of black makeup dripping down her eyes; Sarcastically.] Ha, ha."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,"I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom. [The two girls turn with shocked looks.] For one hundred years, the Fire Nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside. [Walks away from the girls and smirks while looking out of a window.]Â But now we're on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Ty Lee,"[Admiringly.] Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,"From the inside, we're in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li [Turns back into the room.] controls Ba Sing Se."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,Back to the Eastern Air Temple at a creek.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,[Rubs eyes.] What are chakras?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"[Disappointedly.] Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics. [As he explains he points to the water and the moss within.] The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,The creek can't flow?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ... [He removes moss blocking the exit for the water.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,The energy flows! [The water that was blocked by the moss becomes clear. Aang and Pathik smile at each other.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"In another part of the temple, a cavern."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,[Momentarily looks down.] I'll do whatever it takes.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang sees images of things that cause him great fear, including the Blue Spirit attacking him, General Fong sinking Katara into the ground, himself merging with La at the North Pole, Fire Lord Ozai, and Sozin's Comet, which make him scream."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek. [Aang clears the image away.] You have opened your Earth Chakra! [Aang wipes sweat off his forehead.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Later, behind a waterfall."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,Next is the ...
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,Water Chakra?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too! This chakra deals with pleasure and is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt with burdens you so. What do you blame yourself for?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,[Sees the image of him leaving home.] I ran away. [Sees images of him in the Avatar State at General Fong's base.] I hurt all of those people.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself. [Aang takes a deep, focused breath, opening his Water Chakra.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,Scene cuts to the next day at the Water Tribe camp.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the Fire Nation ships from getting through.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Bato,[Filling the mine with skunk fish and seaweed before moving away.] Your father invented tangle mines himself.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,"Destructive? Buoyant? And ... [Sniffs and immediately becomes disgusted.] Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,"Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the ""stink and sink."""
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,"[Laughs.] Good one, Dad!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Bato,"[Nearby, unamused.] You're definitely your father's son."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Warrior,"[Approaching.] Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four Fire Nation ships!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,"Bato, get these mines loaded up! The rest of you men, prepare for battle!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,The warriors run off to prepare as Sokka looks around before looking back to his father.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,"Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,"Aren't you listening? I said, ""The rest of you men, get ready for battle""."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Sokka smiles, nods, and departs. Hakoda smiles proudly. Back in Ba Sing Se, at the Jasmine Dragon. Zuko and Iroh observe the happenings standing at the back."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Iroh,"Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop? Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Zuko,"Congratulations, Uncle."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Iroh,I am very thankful.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Zuko,You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Iroh,No. I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know. [The two embrace.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Zuko,Now let's make these people some tea! [Walks away to the back.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Iroh,"[Overjoyed.] Yes, let's make some tea!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Back to the Eastern Air Temple, Aang and Pathik sit on a ledge."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Third is the Fire Chakra, located in the stomach."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,[Holding his stomach.] My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"[Chuckles.] Good one! Moving on. This chakra deals with willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? [Cuts to Aang's vision of his first attempt at firebending, which resulted in him accidentally burning Katara's hands.] What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,I'm never going to firebend again. I can't.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender. [Aang breathes deeply.] Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"[Loud belch.] Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles? [Pathik shrugs, and hums as if to say ""I don't know"".]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Back at the palace, two Dai Li agents hide on two pillars and secretly spy on a conversation between Mai and Ty Lee. The former is sitting on the stairs and the latter is practicing chi blocking and acrobatics."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Mai,[Sighs.] I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Ty Lee,"Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes. [Punches the air, imitating her chi blocking.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Mai,"How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm going to throw up."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Ty Lee,[Walks on her hands.] Princess Azula promised we would go back to the Fire Nation as soon as we captured the Avatar. We just have to be patient.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Mai,[Stands up.] Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Ty Lee,Sorry!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"The agents smile and climb away. Azula, who was hiding behind another pillar, walks up to them."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,"Good work, girls. I'm sure the Dai Li will deliver the message."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,Back at the Air Temple.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by grief. [Aang smiles and looks at a Air Nomad statue nearby before looking sad.] Lay all your grief out in front of you.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang sees images of many airbenders, including Gyatso and Yangchen. He smiles upon seeing them, but becomes saddened as they start to vanish into smoke."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"You have indeed felt a great loss. [The airbenders appear floating in the clouds.] But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. [Aang is lifted into the air and sees the Air Nomads floating in the smoke.] The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"The smoke in front of Aang forms a face and shows the first thing he saw upon waking up from his iceberg: Katara. Back in the real world, Aang is starting to cry tears of joy."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,Let the pain flow away. [Aang wipes away his tears.] Very good.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"[Choking up.] Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,Inside another part of the temple.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"The fifth in the chain is the Sound Chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang flashes back to when he, Katara, and Sokka first began their journey to the North Pole."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Katara (flashback),Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Back to the real world, Aang finds himself answering the question."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,Because I never wanted to be.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar. [Aang inhales and, seeing an image of himself on a cliff looking down at the ground, exhales, and accepts his nature.] Very good, Aang. You have opened the chakra of truth."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,Outside the temple interior.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"[An image is shown of the world, with the four nations' territories marked.] Like the four nations."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"[The image changes so the territories become the same color.] Yes. We are all one people, [The territories become separate again.] but we live as if divided."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,We're all connected. Everything is connected.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"As Pathik speaks, the camera fades to Xin Fu and Yu trying to take Toph home. She feels around the metal cage with seismic sense and feels tiny particles of earth in the metal. She smiles, exhales deeply and begins to push against the metal."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Toph,"[Struggling.] Come on, metal. Budge! [She punches a hole in the metal and shakes her hand in pain.] Wooo! Toph, you rule."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,She takes another punch as we cut back to Ba Sing Se. Katara walks by the Jasmine Dragon.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Katara,"What do you say, Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king? [Arrives at the shop.] Table for two, please."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Zuko,"Uncle! I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Iroh,I'm brewing as fast as I can!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Katara notices Zuko and Iroh. Stunned, she runs away from the shop."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"The scene returns to Aang and Pathik, who sit at the top of the temple at night."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"This is the last chakra, isn't it?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar State at will and when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,[Smiles with determination.] Let's do this.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"The Thought Chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world. [Images of Katara appear before Aang.] Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river, forgotten."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,[Coming out of his meditation.] What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? [Aang throws his hands up.] How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,You must learn to let go. [Aang contemplates worriedly.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Back at the palace, Katara runs to inform the Earth King, only to encounter the ""Kyoshi Warriors""."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Katara,"Thank goodness you're here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle! [Azula widens her eyes in surprise and smiles slyly.] We have to tell the Earth King right away!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,"Oh, don't worry, I'll be sure to let him know."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Katara notices ""Suki"" has gold eyes and is shocked upon realization that the ""Kyoshi Warriors"" are actually Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee. She prepares to attack, but Ty Lee quickly jumps forward and blocks her chi."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,"[While the three girls gather around the fallen Katara; pans to camera looking up to the three girls.] So, Zuzu's in the city, too? I think it's time for a family reunion. [Momo flies off.]"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,Back at the temple.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,"Okay, I'll try."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang sees an image of him letting Katara go, and a bridge that will lead him to Avatar State mastery. His image looks down, smiles at the bridge, and walks up to the Avatar Spirit, which is an enlarged image of himself in the Avatar State. The Avatar Spirit is holding a ball of energy, and AangÂ walks directly inside of it. As he does so, his tatooes glow, and he closes his eyes. Right before he is able to completely open the final chakra and master the Avatar State, however, he hears a shriek from Katara and sees a vision of her in chains. At this, he jumps out of the energy sphere and runs away from the Avatar Spirit. The energy bridge that lead him there slowly vanishes behind him until it catches up and falls from underneath him, causing his image to plummet toward Earth. This cuts his connection to the Avatar State, which forces him back to reality."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Aang,Katara's in danger! I have to go! [Prepares to exit.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Pathik,"No, Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang hesitates but leaves anyway, leaving Pathik concerned and disappointed. Meanwhile, the journey to take Toph back to her home is stopped when Xin Fu and Yu hear a loud noise. They go to investigate, and notice a hole in the cage and that Toph is gone."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Yu,It's another one her tricks!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Xin Fu,There's a giant hole in the box! How is that a trick!?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Toph,[From behind them.] It's not! It's the real deal!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"She earthbends the two men together, throws them in the cage, and metalbends the cage shut."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Toph,[Jumps on top of the box.] I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it! [Stomps on the box and exits using earth surfing.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Xin Fu,"[Inside the box.] I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Yu,I have to go the bathroom. [Xin Fu groans and slams his head against the box.]
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Back at the Water Tribe camp, Hakoda approaches Sokka."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,"You don't know how much this means to me, Dad. I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,"[Placing his hand on Sokka's shoulder.] Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,Really?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Hakoda,Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Just as the two are boarding the ship, Aang and Appa appear. Aang shows a clear look of concern."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Sokka,This can't be good news.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,,"Aang and Sokka depart. Just as they're leaving, Sokka looks back at Hakoda, who looks back and grins. Back in Ba Sing Se, Azula is led into a prison by two Dai Li agents. She is taken to Long Feng's cell."
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way!
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Long Feng,"But you're not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you, [Standing.] Princess Azula of the Fire Nation?"
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,What do you want?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Long Feng,I want to make a deal. It's time that I regain control of Ba Sing Se and you have something I need.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,Oh?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Long Feng,The Earth King's trust.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,Why should I help you?
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Long Feng,Because I can get you the Avatar.
2,19,The Guru,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Guru,Azula,[Smirks.] I'm listening ...

They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death. [As she talks, an agent with a mustache starts looking nervous and slightly lowers his head.] This coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government. [Walks over to her left, to another agent with a tiny, vertical scar on his right cheek. When she nears him, she stares sideways at the agent while still addressing all the agents.] If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, [She stops right in front of the scarred agent.] I will snuff it out.

3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,Aang,That's right. [Knocking on his head.] Let the molding begin. [The two guards turn away to leave.]
3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,Kwan,Wait a minute. [The two guards turn back.] You're not from the Fire Nation. [Walks around Aang.] Clearly you're from the colonies.

3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,Kwan,"Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you ""Mannerless Colony Slob""?"

3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,Hide,"That's right. Now listen, friend. I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly. [Leans close to Aang, talking slowly.] On Ji is my girlfriend. [Pokes Aang's chest.] Don't forget it."
3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,,Momo tries to get out of Aang's shirt and Aang pushes him back in. Aang pushes Momo back as Hide signifies to Aang that he is watching him and begins to leave.

3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,Sokka,"Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous."
3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,Aang,I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.

[Iroh continues ignoring him.] You're not going to say anything? [Kicks up a small stool and destroys it with firebending.] You're a crazy old man! You're crazy!

3,2,The Headband,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Headband,Aang,"Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush. [The entire class stares at him, dumbfounded.]"

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,"The lady stops and nods her head before disappearing into the water. Cut to the village, the next day. Dock polishes his figurine with a rag as Sokka steps up to the counter."

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Dock/Xu,"Let me check ... [He runs around the shop and ducks beneath the counter to switch hats.] Hey there! Back again, are ya?"
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Toph,[Pushes Sokka away.] We need more food. [Slams the money on the counter.] Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,Xu obligingly presents them with a platter of polluted clams. The camera pans in on the clams. Sokka comically slides in behind them and gives silent chuckle along with a comical annoyed symbol on his forehead. It appears he has an idea brewing.
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Xu,"Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit you in the night, and heal your friend."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Sokka,"[Picks up the clams. Sarcastically.] And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Xu,"[Not getting the sarcasm. Sokka looks annoyed now.] Yeah, maybe! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick folks."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Aang,Is that why this place seems so festive?
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,"A villagers raises a large statue of the Painted Lady in the town square, everyone cheers and applause."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Dock,"Yep, it's all because of the Painted Lady."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Sokka,"Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,[Gets annoyed.] Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Sokka,"Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory. [He makes mocking gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic. He crosses his arms with a smile. Katara gets even more annoyed. The screen pans to the right to show Aang who has his arms crossed not impressed.]"
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Aang,"Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ... [He waves his body with arms in the air making similar gestures to indicate spirit magic. Katara storms away from the two.]"

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,"Cut to Katara on the edge of a dock looking out toward the factory. Cut to the campsite, that night. Katara slips out of her sleeping bag and stuffs dried grass into it to disguise her absence. She dons a makeshift Painted Lady costume, wrapping a ragged gown around her. Katara bends the water to make a mirror so she can apply the markings. She puts on a wide conical hat similar to the Painted Lady's, but with a diaphanous white veil covering her face. She glides away toward the village, but not quietly enough; she wakes Momo, and he wakes Aang by jumping on him."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Aang,"What's the matter, buddy? [Katara leaves Team Avatar.] It's her! [Excited, waves his hand to Katara and puts on his headband.] Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!"
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,"Katara shocked, quickly flees from Aang. Meanwhile, Aang uses his airbending to accelerate his run. The camera moves to a hill as Katara climbs up and continues on as Aang easily keeps up."

[Continues to follow her down the hill as she crosses the river.] Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine! [Aang freezes some water to form stepping stones to cross the river.] I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends! [Katara moves faster, and Aang jumps on a wooden bridge. Katara runs out of the river onto the docks and notices Aang's reflection in the water. She looks up and sees Aang running across a roof.] Heeey! [He suddenly hits a pole, Katara flinches and feels sorry for him but continues on across the river to the other side. She stops to look out at the village thinking she is safe but Aang drops in front of her.] My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar. [Lifts his headband and points at his arrow.]"
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,"[Using a disguised voice.] Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Aang,"Yeah, me too. I hate that. [Looks at Katara's face from behind the veil.] You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive. [Looks at Katara suspiciously. Tries to look under the hat.]"

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Aang,[Shocked.] You're the Painted Lady? [Pointing at Katara.] But how?
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,"I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village. [Takes her hat off.] But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her. [Drops her hat on the ground.]"
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Aang,"So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick?"
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,"He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!"

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,"Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,Aang gives her a curious look. Cut to the Fire Nation factory. Aang and Katara run along the river's edge toward it. Aang looks at the polluted water.
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Aang,You wanna destroy this factory?
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,"Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,"Aang and Katara enter and move to different sides of the factory. Katara uses waterbending to cut the metal hooks that hang barrels of a magma. Aang, with protective gloves on, overturns bigger hanging barrels, smiling at his work. Aang uses earthbending to break apart the pipe system in the factory. Katara bends a huge wave of water through the windows and floods the factory. The scene cuts to outside as the factory explodes from within and muck stops flowing from the pipes. Cut to Aang and Katara walking back to their campsite. Aang laughs and makes explosion noises."
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,"Shhh! [Quietly.] We don't wanna wake Sokka. [She turns and sees that Sokka and Toph are awake.] Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk!"

[Dumps the hay out of Katara's sleeping bag.] I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him [Sticks out his own tongue.] purpleising tongue berries! [Toph sticks out her tongue and shows that it is purple and holds up a bag of berries which Momo starts eating.] Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now!"
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,Katara walks past Sokka sadly. Sokka confronts Aang as he follows.
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Sokka,And how long did you know about this?

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,,"Aang sprints away with airbending. The scene changes to the Fire Nation factory where a man can be seen coming out of the smoke and looking angrily toward the town. Cut to Team Avatar packing, but they pause when they hear buzzing.

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Katara,[Defensively.] It was your idea!
3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Sokka,I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises! [Slaps his forehead.] Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge!

3,3,The Painted Lady,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Painted_Lady,Sokka,Leave! Do nothing!

3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Toph,So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Sokka,"Nah, she's pretty much a pain. [Katara, looking up at their feet from below and behind, glares and looks away.] She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ..."
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Toph,Yeah. I don't know how you could deal with it.
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Sokka,"Actually, in a way, I rely on it. [Katara looks back up at them.]"
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Toph,I don't understand.
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Sokka,"When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom."
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Toph,I guess I never thought about that.
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Sokka,"I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture. [Katara, touched by what Sokka says, is reduced to tears.]"
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Toph,"The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. [Wipes away tears from her left eye.] You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. [Katara, deeply touched by Toph's words, sinks slightly into the water. Toph punches Sokka in the arm.] Don't ever tell her I said any of this!"
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Sokka,"Hey, my lips are sealed."

So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. [As she speaks, the screen fades to the beginning of the episode, where Toph is seen running from the authorities and is caught in a net.]"

3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Katara,[Crosses her arms.] You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. [Turns away from Toph.]

3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Katara,I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.
3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Toph,"Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with."

3,7,The Runaway,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Runaway,Toph,I left it back at camp. [Sits down.] I was worried they would take it.

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Shop owner,"Well, I have to send the boy to Hing Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Villager,"Oh, right. Tomorrow's the full moon."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Shop owner,[In a lowered voice.] Exactly. I can't lose another delivery boy in the woods.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"Cuts to shot of Aang, Sokka, and Toph walking through the marketplace. Aang carrying a package slung over his shoulder, Sokka carrying a package attached to his sword, while Toph carries a large, round basket on her head."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons? This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,"I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"[Makes gesture with his hand.] And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,[Proudly.] Helping people ... that's what I do.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"Cuts to overhead shot of the group standing in the marketplace as he, Sokka and Toph approach Katara and Hama."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,Why don't you take all those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,[Walks up to her.] This is a mysterious little town you have here.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Extremely close-up. Ominously.] Mysterious town for mysterious children.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"She smiles creepily and saunters away, leaving Sokka feeling suspicious. The scene changes to a shot of Hama's inn, starting outside, before moving inside, where the gang is unpacking groceries. Sokka walks over to a counter and sets his basket down."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Unpacking items.] That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. [Picks up cabbage.] She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"But what did she mean by that comment, ""mysterious children""?"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,I'm gonna take a look around. [Walks away and up a flight of wooden stairs.]
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"[Appears along with the others at the bottom of the stairwell.] Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? [Off-camera as Sokka peers around the inn.] You can't just snoop around someone's house."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,It'll be fine.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,[Off-camera while Sokka peers into a room.] She could be home any minute.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"[Walking down hallway with the rest of the team.] Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"[Tugging on a cupboard door.] I'm not finished yet. [Grunts, as he tries to pull it free.] Come on ..."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The cupboard suddenly opens, revealing several wooden puppets stowed inside. The dolls fall forward, held together only by their strings. Everyone gasps; Sokka withdraws his sword, backs up and points it straight at the puppets."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,"Okay, that's pretty creepy."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"[Walks over and closes the cupboard; a bit weirded out.] So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. [Angrily.] Sokka, you've looked enough. [Off-camera as Sokka ascends into the attic.] Hama will be back soon."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here?"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Annoyed.] Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"We'll see. [Peers through the keyhole into the room. Cuts to shot of the attic from his perspective. Through the keyhole, a small room can be seen, with a chest lying on the ground in the middle. The camera zooms in on the chest.] It's empty, except for a little chest."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,Maybe it's treasure!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"Sokka grows excited, his eyes growing wide, and uses his sword to pick the lock."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"[Approaches him.] Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,I have to see what's in there.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,The door unlocks and creaks open. The four step cautiously inside; Sokka puts away his sword and approaches the small chest.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,We shouldn't be doing this.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"Sokka picks up the chest and tries to pry it open, only to discover it is locked."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,Maybe there's a key here somewhere ...

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"She takes the chest, removes her meteor bracelet from her arm and earthbends it into the shape of a small key, which she sticks into the keyhole of the chest."

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,"[Annoyed; Katara appears from behind her, peering nervously over her shoulder.] This isn't as easy as it looks!"

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,This is crazy! I'm leaving!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"Suit yourself! Do it, Toph!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"Katara turns to leave the moment Toph signals that she has successfully opened the chest, holding her thumb up. All four eagerly surround the box in a comical fashion, anticipating what they will find inside."

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"All, except Toph, scream and turn sharply to find Hama standing in the doorway.

Cuts to close-up of Sokka, his eyes wide in anxiousness, and a shot of Hama still in the process of lifting the object. Cuts to shot of the team standing together from her perspective. Her left arm appears on-screen, a blue whale tooth comb in her hand. Cuts to shot of her holding the comb, smiling."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,[Surprised.] An old comb?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The camera zooms in on Katara and Sokka, who stare at her in astonishment."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Stunned.] You're from the Southern Water Tribe?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Sets down comb.] Just like you.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,How did you know?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,I heard you talking around your campfire.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,But why didn't you tell us?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,[Sticking his tongue out in disgust.] Great ...
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,I knew I felt a bond with you right away.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. [Grimaces as Katara hits him in the arm.] But I'm sorry we were sneaking around."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"Apology accepted. [Turns to the side and motions with her hand.] Now, let's get cooking!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The scene changes to later that night, where Aang races from the inn to the barn located toward the back of the property. Cuts to overhead shot of inside the barn, where Appa and Momo lie. The doors creak open and Aang steps inside. Cuts to ground-level shot of him standing before the bison, tossing a cabbage-like vegetable into Appa's mouth. Momo dances in front of the bison's face and chitters, irritated. Appa opens his mouth and releases the cabbage, which Momo grabs. The lemur skitters away. Cuts to shot of Hama's kitchen table, as she sets down a bowl of soup. Cuts to shot of the entire room, the team and the innkeeper sitting around the table. Sokka is seen chewing on a food item, as Hama takes her seat at the head of the table."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,[Whispering to Toph.] I'd steer clear of the sea prunes.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,I thought they were ocean kumquats.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,Close enough.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,Who wants five flavor soup?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"All four raise their hands in acceptance.

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Delighted.] You're a waterbender! [Faces Hama in delight.] I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Cuts to side-view of her; sadly.] That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one ...

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,So how did you end up out here?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Grimly.] I was stolen from my home.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,The scene fades to a flashback of a much younger Hama peacefully sauntering through her Southern Water Tribe village.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Voice-over.] It was over sixty years ago when the raids started.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"She approaches her friend, Kanna, and they share a laugh before they notice ashen snow falling from the sky. The two race to the shores, where five Fire Nation ships are rapidly approaching the tribe. Five fireballs are launched from trebuchets and strike the village. Fire Nation soldiers swarm the area, battling the waterbenders, who desperately attempt to fend them off."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Voice-over.] They came again and again, each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The battle scene fades to another scene, where Hama and several other waterbenders use waterbending to capsize a Fire Nation vessel."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Voice-over.] We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"As she is narrating, Water Tribe civilians who aided in the suspension of the vessel are seen slowly fading, signaling their capture by the Fire Nation. The camera rotates around her and zooms out, revealing dozens of firebenders surrounding her."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Voice-over.] Finally, I too was captured."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The younger Hama is seen being led by Fire Nation soldiers onto one of their naval vessels, having now been captured herself."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Voice-over.] I was led away in chains. The last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"A final scene shows her looking out onto her tribe's members, including her friend, Kanna, in tears as the bow creaks upward. The flashback ends. Now in present time, Katara is seen walking over to Hama and placing her arms around her shoulder comfortingly."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Sympathetically.] Oh, you poor things."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,Aang and Sokka cast their heads down solemnly.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"She bows to her newfound friend, who smiles warmly. The scene changes to the next day, where Hama and Katara are strolling on the outskirts of Hama's village."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. But as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Stops walking.] That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Smiling.] That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air?"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"In a quick movement of her right arm, Hama uses waterbending to manipulate the water vapor in the air, liquefying it and coating her fingertips."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"You have got to keep an open mind, Katara. [The water around her fingertips freezes, creating ice claws.] There's water in places you never think about."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,The camera focuses on Toph and Sokka. Toph is standing casually near where Sokka is deeply inhaling the aroma of a bundle of flowers.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"[Angrily.] The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,"[Catches sight of a villager walking past.] Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Villager,Only one man ever saw it and lived and that's Old Man Ding.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,Where does Old Man Ding live?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The scene changes to a field of fire lilies, where Hama continues to tutor Katara in waterbending."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"Wow, these flowers are beautiful."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,You can take it even further.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"In a sharp, swiveling motion, she draws water from dozens of the surrounding fire lilies and slices a nearby rock clean through."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"That was incredible! [Sees the wilted lilies.] It's a shame about the lilies, though."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Cautiously.] But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon? [Begins walking away.] I don't think we have anything to worry about."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The two exit the field. The scene fades to later that night, where Aang, Sokka, and Toph are approaching Old Man Ding, who is boarding up his windows."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,Old Man Ding?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Ding,"Huh? [Accidentally hammers his thumb.] Ow, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy? Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old! [Attempts to lift a wooden plank off the ground, but fails to do so. Sighs.] Well, I'm young at heart."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,Aang approaches and helps Ding lift the board.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Ding,Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,[Proceeds to nail the board to the window frame.] We wanted to ask you about that.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Aang,Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Ding,"Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain. [Points to the mountain.] I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. It just about had me into a cave up there. [Imitates a walking puppet.] And I looked up at the moon for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light. [Cuts to shot of the trio, Sokka quivering in fear.] But then the sun started to rise and I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,Oh no! [Sokka and Aang assume defensive positions.] I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"They all stare at the mountain. The scene changes to where Aang, Sokka, and Toph are racing through the dark forest in search of the imprisoned villagers."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,[Feels the ground with her hand.] I can hear them. They're this way!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The trio proceeds to sprint toward the mountain. Meanwhile, Hama and Katara venture into the moonlit forest."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,Can you feel the power the full moon brings?
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"She inhales deeply through her nose and stretches her arms outward, flexing her limbs which causes her veins to bulge out, while Katara looks on in disgust."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"For generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,The camera depicts a shot of her standing beneath the full moon.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Extreme close-up; in a sinister tone.] I've never felt more alive.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The scene changes to Aang, Sokka, and Toph, who have arrived at the mountain and are standing before the mouth of the cave."

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Toph,[Grabs Sokka's hand.] That's why you have me. Let's go!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The three descend into the dark cave and approach a solid metal door, torches nearby. Using metalbending, Toph breaks it down, while the trio proceeds to make their way through the tunnel, Aang and Sokka lighting their path with the torches.

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"Aang and Sokka flee from the scene, while Toph stays behind. The scene switches to the forest. A cat owl hoots and flies away. The camera focuses on Hama and Katara, their backs facing the camera, the wind blowing their hair slightly, looking toward the moon."

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Voice-over.] The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. [A side-view is shown of Fire Nation guards giving water to a tied up prisoner.] Any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution. [Cuts to shot of the full moon in the sky during present day.] And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. [Cuts to shot of Hama.] There had to be something I could do to escape. [Scene fades to flashback of the prison.] Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. [A younger Hama is shown bending the water inside an elephant rat that had wandered its way into her cage.] The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape. [A close-up is shown of Hama smiling at her discovery. The scene fades back to present day. Ominously.] Bloodbending. [Cut to a scared Katara.] Controlling the water in another body, [Cut to ground shot of both Hama and Katara.] enforcing your own will over theirs. [The scene fades back to a flashback of young Hama controlling a horde of rats using bloodbending.] Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"The camera switches over to show a Fire Nation guard strolling past the cages when a sudden feeling comes over him. Using bloodbending, Hama forces the guard to grab hold of his keys and unlock her cell, thus marking her escape."

[The guard attempts to get up, but Hama quickly forces him back down to the ground. She walks unsteadily away.] My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in. [Scene changes back to present day; camera focuses on a close-up of Hama.] Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything or [Looks at Katara from the corner of her eyes sadistically.] anyone."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Unsure.] But ... to reach inside someone and control them? [Casts unsure glance off to the side.] I don't know if I want that kind of power.
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Camera zooms out to the two standing in the forest.] The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. [Closes up to Hama.] Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Close-up of her face.] I know.

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Widens eyes in realization.] It's you ... [Angrily.] You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Close-up of her face, as she tilts her head downward.] They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work!"

I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town! [Her hand suddenly twists to one side. She tries desperately to stop it, but fails to do so.]"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,"[Now using bloodbending to subdue to her.] You should've learned the technique before you turned against me! [Forces Katara into a strained position.] It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"With swift motions of her hands and arms, Hama uses bloodbending to twist Katara around and throw her from side to side. She positions Katara directly before her and uses a downward motion of her hand to force her into a submissive state."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,[Tearfully.] Stop! Please ...
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"Hama laughs cruelly and keeps Katara subdued. The shot is showing the full moon slowly fades to a close-up of Katara's face as she is crying. Several moments pass as the young waterbender begins to break free from Hama's grip. Hama stares in shock as Katara inhales deeply and rises, now free from her grasp."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Katara,"[Determined.] You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! [Assumes a fighting stance.] My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!"
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"A waterbending duel ensues between the two. Katara pulls a ring of water around her waist and sends the stream of water at Hama, who halts it and sends it back to Katara. In a swift spinning motion, Katara sends the stream toward Hama again, who draws water from nearby trees, deflects the attack and sends a highly pressurized water jet at her. Katara uses her hands to block the attack, disintegrating the water into droplets. Upon seeing Katara's bending prowess, Hama becomes shocked, allowing for her opponent to use waterbending to knock her to the ground."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Hama,[Shouts.] Aahhh!

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"She begins bloodbending Aang and Sokka, who yell in fear, and sends them in Katara's direction. Katara pushes them out of her way and draws water from the ground, sending a stream at Hama, who in turn draws water from a vine and uses a water wheel to deflect the attack."
3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,Sokka,"[Unwillingly draws his sword.] Katara, look out! [Forced to walk like a puppet, while waving the blade back and forth rapidly.] It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!"

3,8,The Puppetmaster,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Puppetmaster,,"She catches sight of Sokka, still under Hama's power, unwillingly prepared to strike her with his sword. She draws water from a vine and freezes his sword and hand to a tree as well."

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,Sokka stands up quickly and steps in front of Aang.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Sokka,But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber!
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,[While pointing at the cliff nearby.] Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast!
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,"Camera turns to show the size of the cliff. When it sets back on Sokka, he looks at Aang, pointing to the cliff. Aang nods fast, and Sokka reluctantly begins to climb it."

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,"Sokka is seen behind Aang falling off the cliff after hearing Aang. Toph spits out the water onto Katara, who waterbends it off her."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Toph,Why? Is it poisoned?
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,"In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom! [He puts his hands between his legs and squeezes them together.] We died because of your tiny bladder. [He turns to Katara.] And you need to start wearing your hair up. In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-."

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,[He takes a deep breath before finally speaking.] You're right. I'm losing my mind.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,"Sokka is still climbing the cliff, and almost reaches the top, but is seen sliding down. Cut to the sun in the sky. Cut to Aang's face, his eye twitching, as he paces around, stressed. Cut to his hands rotating between putting his thumb and finger together before alternating to the opposites on the other hand."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,"It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves."

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Sokka,[Standing.] What? It's true. That's the deal. He knows it.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,"Katara pushes down Sokka to sit, before looking over at Aang, who is nervously shaking. She walks over to him and touches his shoulders."

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Katara,"These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up. [Katara puts her hands above her head together, Aang follows along.] Reach for the sun. [They wave their hands and upper bodies side to side.] Feel your chi paths clearing.

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,[Close-up of Aang sweating.] I feel ... really warm.

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat. [Becoming frantic again.] Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,"An orange flame is seen circling around, covering the view, before disappearing. Aang gets out of his position and lands on his back, panting."

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Sokka,"[Nodding in agreement.] Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,Okay! But what can I do to feel better?
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Sokka,[While handing Aang a koala sheep.] Want to try screaming into this pillow?
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,"Aang does so. Once his face is out of the wool, the koala sheep makes a noise at him.

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Azula,What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there!
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Zuko,"Oh, yeah?! I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it!"
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Azula,"Oh, Zuko. Don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably just weren't invited because it's so obvious you're supposed to be there."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Zuko,"Well, were you invited?"
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Azula,Of course! I'm the princess.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Zuko,And I'm the prince!
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Azula,"Exactly, so stop acting like a paranoid child! Just go to the meeting."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Zuko,Forget it! I'm not going!
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,Zuko turns around and walks away. The scene changes to Aang lying down on some pillars.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Toph,All right! What you need is a good old-fashioned back pounding to relieve your stress.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,[Looking up at her.] Pound away.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,,"Toph begins stomping fiercely, causing the pillars to move up and down in various order."

[Aang grabs onto the edge of the pillars and gets up.] Well, there's one other thing we can try. [She stomps the ground, sending a distant boar-q-pine to her.

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Zuko,I don't.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Mai,"Well, good. You shouldn't. I mean, why would you even want to go? Just think about how things went the last meeting you went to."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Zuko,[Sighs.] I know.
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Mai,You know what will make you feel better? [Zuko turns his head slightly.] Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time.

Aang slowly lies down, and closes his eyes, leading to another dream. It begins with a thunderstorm, with Aang riding on Appa through it. They fly by a giant Momo, who tries hitting them down, and grabs them in his hand. It changes to an image of the Fire Nation Royal Palace, and Aang emerges in the water, and is pushed forward into the palace. He looks in all directions, waiting for something to happen. Toph is seen rotating around. Her bangs move to reveal that her eyes are blank. She falls down under the floor in front of Aang, who becomes scared. Sokka tries running away, but some wet earth closes around him. Katara is seen surrounded by fire. Aang tries to go save her, but his feet are frozen to the ground. Ice crawls up his body, and he reaches out, but he's completely frozen. The ground that he was on becomes completely ice. Ozai, as a fire monster, begins laughing and melts the ice, which makes Aang fall down. He is released from his form and falls into some water, where he sinks to the bottom and looks through the floor, seeing Zuko as if he was standing above. The comet is seen passing by behind Zuko. Aang is seen still holding his breath. The comet is shown rushing down. Momo is seen telling someone to be quiet. Aang is standing on grass and seeing bushes and mountains when the comet strikes the ground, and everything is scorched and on fire. He quickly wakes up, screaming and waking everyone else up. Appa becomes scared, and Momo slides off him. Everyone rushes over to him."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Katara,"What happened, Aang?"
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,[Turns away on hands and knees.] It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,[Momentarily looking back.] No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Katara,"Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,"[Walking toward the cliff edge. Katara turns and moves a bit to follow.] Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara."
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Katara,What big things?
3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,"I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this.

3,9,Nightmares and Daydreams,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Nightmares_and_Daydreams,Aang,"[He pauses to think for a moment.] Uh, living underwater?"

Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have believed that! Stupid! [A badgerfrog croaks at him.] Uggh!"
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,,Back at the air temple.
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,Why would he try to fool us like that?
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,"He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes."
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,"The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him."
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Aang,I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,"Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!"
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,I could feel it! It's my throatal flap!
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Aang,"Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me."
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,"Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him."
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Aang,You're probably right.
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Toph,"Actually, he wasn't lying."
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,"[Sarcastically.] Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list."

3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Toph,"All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly."
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates!
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island!
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Aang,Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple!
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,Why would you even try to defend him?
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Toph,"[Angrily.] Because Katara, you're all ignoring one crucial fact: [Pokes Aang in the chest.] Aang needs a firebending teacher!

3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Haru,Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Katara,I think we should go look for her.
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,[Sitting.] Let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.

3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Teo,[Has a bandage around his forehead.] Yeah! I want to ride that tunnel down to the Hall of Statues again. It will work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes.

3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,So he attacked you?
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Toph,"Well, he did, and he didn't. It was sort of an accident."
3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Aang,But he did firebend at you?

3,12,The Western Air Temple,https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:The_Western_Air_Temple,Sokka,Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.

Cut to a close up of Aang as he stands up from behind the fountain pool and runs to the side. Cut to a shot of Aang doing a spinning back kick, airbending and kicking up the dust around him, and leaping straight up just as a blast from Combustion Man explodes beneath him. The camera turns up to Aang spinning in mid air, airbending a tornado and kicking it at Combustion Man. Combustion Man leaps over the tornado and fires another blast as he descends. Aang lands and quickly back flips away from the blast, landing next to Katara and Sokka. Cut to a shot of Combustion Man falling before switching to a shot of his metal, clawed hand as it catches on a small ledge and breaks it, slowing his fall. He lands on a new ledge and rolls, firing a blast just as he stops. Cut to a shot of Katara and Aang shielding themselves as the blast hits the fountain water.

Cut to a shot of Combustion Man as the icicles speed toward him. He brings his metal arm over his face and lifts his metal leg to shield him from the attack. The icicles break against him. Combustion Man flings his arms down to shake off the ice shards and steps forward, an angry frown on his face. Cut to his perspective as he scans the area. The group is nowhere to be seen. Aang fires a tornado, which the assassin jumps over and fires again. Aang narrowly avoids the blast by jumping back. Combustion man falls and lands on a ledge as he fires and misses again.

But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. [To Toph.] I'm sorry for what I did to you. [Bows to her.] It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally."
